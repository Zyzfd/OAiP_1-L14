<br>CHAPTER ONE
<br>
<br>THE BOY WHO LIVED
<br>
<br>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of <b>number</b>  four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
<br>that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last
<br>people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,
<br>because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
<br>
<br>Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
<br>drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did
<br>have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had
<br>nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she
<br>spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
<br>neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their
<br>opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
<br>
<br>The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and
<br>their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't
<br>think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.
<br>Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;
<br>in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her
<br>sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was
<br>possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would
<br>say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the
<br>Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy
<br>was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want
<br>Dudley mixing with a child like that.
<br>
<br>When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story
<br>starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that
<br>strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the
<br>country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for
<br>work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
<br>Dudley into his high chair.
<br>
<br>None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
<br>
<br>At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.
<br>Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,
<br>because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the
<br>walls. "Little tyke," chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got
<br>into his car and backed out of <b>number</b>  four's drive.
<br>
<br>It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of
<br>something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley
<br>didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to
<br>look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet
<br>Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking
<br>of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and
<br>stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the
<br>corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now
<br>reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats
<br>couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and
<br>put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of
<br>nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
<br>
<br>But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
<br>else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help
<br>noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people
<br>about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in
<br>funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this
<br>was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering
<br>wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite
<br>close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was
<br>enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man
<br>had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The
<br>nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some
<br>silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...
<br>yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr.
<br>Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
<br>
<br>Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the
<br>ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate
<br>on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad
<br>daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed
<br>open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never
<br>seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly
<br>normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made
<br>several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a
<br>very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs
<br>and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
<br>
<br>He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of
<br>them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't
<br>know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering
<br>excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on
<br>his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he
<br>caught a few words of what they were saying.
<br>
<br>"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry"
<br>
<br>Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the
<br>whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better
<br>of it.
<br>
<br>He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his
<br>secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had <b>almost</b> 
<br>finished dialing his home <b>number</b>  when he changed his mind. He put the
<br>receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was
<br>being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were
<br>lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think
<br>of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even
<br>seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point
<br>in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her
<br>sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all
<br>the same, those people in cloaks...
<br>
<br>He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and
<br>when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that
<br>he walked straight into someone just outside the door.
<br>
<br>"Sorry," he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and <b>almost</b>  fell. It
<br>was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a
<br>violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being <b>almost</b>  knocked to the
<br>ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in
<br>a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir,
<br>for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at
<br>last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy,
<br>happy day!"
<br>
<br>And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
<br>
<br>Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete
<br>stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that
<br>was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping
<br>he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he
<br>didn't approve of imagination.
<br>
<br>As he pulled into the driveway of <b>number</b>  four, the first thing he saw --
<br>and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that
<br>morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the
<br>same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.
<br>
<br>"Shoo!" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a
<br>stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying
<br>to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still
<br>determined not to mention anything to his wife.
<br>
<br>Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all
<br>about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had
<br>learned a new word ("Won't!"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When
<br>Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to
<br>catch the last report on the evening news:
<br>
<br>"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's
<br>owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally
<br>hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been
<br>hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since
<br>sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly
<br>changed their sleeping pattern." The newscaster allowed himself a grin.
<br>"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going
<br>to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?"
<br>
<br>"Well, Ted," said the weatherman, "I don't know about that, but it's not
<br>only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as
<br>Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead
<br>of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting
<br>stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's
<br>not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight."
<br>
<br>Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?
<br>Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?
<br>And a <b>whisper</b> , a <b>whisper</b>  about the Potters...
<br>
<br>Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was
<br>no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat
<br>nervously. "Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister
<br>lately, have you?"
<br>
<br>As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,
<br>they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.
<br>
<br>"No," she said sharply. "Why?"
<br>
<br>"Funny stuff on the news," Mr. Dursley mumbled. "Owls... shooting
<br>stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today..."
<br>
<br>"So?" snapped Mrs. Dursley.
<br>
<br>"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you
<br>know... her crowd."
<br>
<br>Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered
<br>whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name "Potter." He decided he
<br>didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, "Their son --
<br>he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?"
<br>
<br>"I suppose so," said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.
<br>
<br>"What's his name again? Howard, <b>isn</b> 't it?"
<br>
<br>"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me."
<br>
<br>"Oh, yes," said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. "Yes, I quite
<br>agree."
<br>
<br>He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.
<br>While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom
<br>window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there.
<br>It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for
<br>something.
<br>
<br>Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the
<br>Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of
<br>-- well, he didn't think he could bear it.
<br>
<br>The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.
<br>Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting
<br>thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were
<br>involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs.
<br>Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about
<br>them and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get
<br>mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over
<br>-- it couldn't affect them....
<br>
<br>How very wrong he was.
<br>
<br>Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat
<br>on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as
<br>still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of
<br>Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the
<br>next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly
<br>midnight before the cat moved at all.
<br>
<br>A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so
<br>suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the
<br>ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.
<br>
<br>Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,
<br>thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which
<br>were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes,
<br>a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.
<br>His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon
<br>spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been
<br>broken at least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.
<br>
<br>Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a
<br>street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was
<br>busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to
<br>realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat,
<br>which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For
<br>some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and
<br>muttered, "I should have known."
<br>
<br>He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a
<br>silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and
<br>clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He
<br>clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times
<br>he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street
<br>were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
<br>watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed
<br>Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening
<br>down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his
<br>cloak and set off down the street toward <b>number</b>  four, where he sat down
<br>on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he
<br>spoke to it.
<br>
<br>"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall."
<br>
<br>He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling
<br>at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly
<br>the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was
<br>wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight
<br>bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.
<br>
<br>"How did you know it was me?" she asked.
<br>
<br>"My dear Professor, I 've never seen a cat sit so stiffly."
<br>
<br>"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day," said
<br>Professor McGonagall.
<br>
<br>"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a
<br>dozen feasts and parties on my way here."
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
<br>
<br>"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right," she said impatiently.
<br>"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles
<br>have noticed something's going on. It was on their news." She jerked her
<br>head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window. "I heard it. Flocks
<br>of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They
<br>were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet
<br>that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense."
<br>
<br>"You can't blame them," said Dumbledore gently. "We've had precious
<br>little to celebrate for eleven years."
<br>
<br>"I know that," said Professor McGonagall irritably. "But that's no
<br>reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on
<br>the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes,
<br>swapping rumors."
<br>
<br>She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping
<br>he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. "A
<br>fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have
<br>disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he
<br>really has gone, Dumbledore?"
<br>
<br>"It certainly seems so," said Dumbledore. "We have much to be thankful
<br>for. Would you care for a lemon drop?"
<br>
<br>"A what?"
<br>
<br>"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of"
<br>
<br>"No, thank you," said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't
<br>think this was the moment for lemon drops. "As I say, even if
<br>You-Know-Who has gone -"
<br>
<br>"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him
<br>by his name? All this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I
<br>have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:
<br>Voldemort." Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was
<br>unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. "It all gets so
<br>confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason
<br>to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.
<br>
<br>"I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
<br>exasperated, half admiring. "But you're different. Everyone knows you're
<br>the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of."
<br>
<br>"You flatter me," said Dumbledore calmly. "Voldemort had powers I will
<br>never have."
<br>
<br>"Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them."
<br>
<br>"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey
<br>told me she liked my new earmuffs."
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall <b>shot</b>  a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, "The owls
<br>are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what
<br>everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally
<br>stopped him?"
<br>
<br>It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most
<br>anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard
<br>wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed
<br>Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that
<br>whatever "everyone" was saying, she was not going to believe it until
<br>Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing
<br>another lemon drop and did not answer.
<br>
<br>"What they're saying," she pressed on, "is that last night Voldemort
<br>turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is
<br>that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead. "
<br>
<br>Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.
<br>
<br>"Lily and James... I can't believe it... I didn't want to believe it...
<br>Oh, Albus..."
<br>
<br>Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. "I know... I
<br>know..." he said heavily.
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. "That's not all.
<br>They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he
<br>couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how,
<br>but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's
<br>power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.
<br>
<br>Dumbledore nodded glumly.
<br>
<br>"It's -- it's true?" faltered Professor McGonagall. "After all he's
<br>done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill a little boy?
<br>It's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the
<br>name of heaven did Harry survive?"
<br>
<br>"We can only guess," said Dumbledore. "We may never know."
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace <b>handkerchief</b>  and dabbed at her
<br>eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a
<br>golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch.
<br>It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
<br>around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because
<br>he put it back in his pocket and said, "Hagrid's late. I suppose it was
<br>he who told you I'd be here, by the way?"
<br>
<br>"Yes," said Professor McGonagall. "And I don't suppose you're going to
<br>tell me why you're here, of all places?"
<br>
<br>"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family
<br>he has left now."
<br>
<br>"You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?" cried
<br>Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at <b>number</b>  four.
<br>"Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't
<br>find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw
<br>him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.
<br>Harry Potter come and live here!"
<br>
<br>"It's the best place for him," said Dumbledore firmly. "His aunt and
<br>uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've
<br>written them a letter."
<br>
<br>"A letter?" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on
<br>the wall. "Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a
<br>letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous -- a
<br>legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day
<br>in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child
<br>in our world will know his name!"
<br>
<br>"Exactly," said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his
<br>half-moon glasses. "It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous
<br>before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even
<br>remember! CarA you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away
<br>from all that until he's ready to take it?"
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and
<br>then said, "Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy
<br>getting here, Dumbledore?" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she
<br>thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.
<br>
<br>"Hagrid's bringing him."
<br>
<br>"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as
<br>this?"
<br>
<br>I would trust Hagrid with my life," said Dumbledore.
<br>
<br>"I'm not saying his heart <b>isn</b> 't in the right place," said Professor
<br>McGonagall grudgingly, "but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does
<br>tend to -- what was that?"
<br>
<br>A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew
<br>steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a
<br>headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and
<br>a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of
<br>them.
<br>
<br>If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride
<br>it. He was <b>almost</b>  twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times
<br>as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long
<br>tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands
<br>the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were
<br>like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle
<br>of blankets.
<br>
<br>"Hagrid," said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. "At last. And where did
<br>you get that motorcycle?"
<br>
<br>"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit," said the giant, climbing
<br>carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. "Young Sirius Black lent it to
<br>me. I've got him, sir."
<br>
<br>"No problems, were there?"
<br>
<br>"No, sir -- house was <b>almost</b>  destroyed, but I got him out all right
<br>before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was
<br>flyin' over Bristol."
<br>
<br>Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of
<br>blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a
<br>tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously
<br>shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.
<br>
<br>"Is that where -?" whispered Professor McGonagall.
<br>
<br>"Yes," said Dumbledore. "He'll have that scar forever."
<br>
<br>"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?"
<br>
<br>"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself
<br>above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well
<br>-- give him here, Hagrid -- we'd better get this over with."
<br>
<br>Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.
<br>
<br>"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?" asked Hagrid. He bent his
<br>great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very
<br>scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a
<br>wounded dog.
<br>
<br>"Shhh!" hissed Professor McGonagall, "you'll wake the Muggles!"
<br>
<br>"S-s-sorry," sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted <b>handkerchief</b>  and
<br>burying his face in it. "But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead
<br>-- an' <b>poor</b>  little Harry off ter live with Muggles -"
<br>
<br>"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or
<br>we'll be found," Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly
<br>on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to
<br>the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out
<br>of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to
<br>the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at
<br>the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall
<br>blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from
<br>Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.
<br>
<br>"Well," said Dumbledore finally, "that's that. We've no business staying
<br>here. We may as well go and join the celebrations."
<br>
<br>"Yeah," said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, "I'll be takin' Sirius his
<br>bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir."
<br>
<br>Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself
<br>onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose
<br>into the air and off into the night.
<br>
<br>"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall," said Dumbledore,
<br>nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.
<br>
<br>Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he
<br>stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and
<br>twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet
<br>Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking
<br>around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the
<br>bundle of blankets on the step of <b>number</b>  four.
<br>
<br>"Good luck, Harry," he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish
<br>of his cloak, he was gone.
<br>
<br>A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and
<br>tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect
<br>astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his
<br>blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside
<br>him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was
<br>famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs.
<br>Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk
<br>bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and
<br>pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn't know that at this very
<br>moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up
<br>their glasses and saying in hushed voices: "To Harry Potter -- the boy
<br>who lived!"
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER TWO
<br>
<br>THE VANISHING GLASS
<br>
<br>Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find
<br>their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at
<br>all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass
<br><b>number</b>  four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living
<br>room, which was <b>almost</b>  exactly the same as it had been on the night when
<br>Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the
<br>photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.
<br>Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a
<br>large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley
<br>Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large
<br>blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a
<br>computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.
<br>The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.
<br>
<br>Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for
<br>long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made
<br>the first noise of the day.
<br>
<br>"Up! Get up! Now!"
<br>
<br>Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.
<br>
<br>"Up!" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then
<br>the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his
<br>back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a
<br>good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny
<br>feeling he'd had the same dream before.
<br>
<br>His aunt was back outside the door.
<br>
<br>"Are you up yet?" she demanded.
<br>
<br>"Nearly," said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you
<br>dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday."
<br>
<br>Harry groaned.
<br>
<br>"What did you say?" his aunt snapped through the door.
<br>
<br>"Nothing, nothing..."
<br>
<br>Dudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out
<br>of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and,
<br>after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to
<br>spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and
<br>that was where he slept.
<br>
<br>When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table
<br>was <b>almost</b>  hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as
<br>though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the
<br>second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a
<br>racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated
<br>exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's
<br>favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry
<br>didn't look it, but he was very fast.
<br>
<br>Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry
<br>had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and
<br>skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes
<br>of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry
<br>had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He
<br>wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of
<br>all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry
<br>liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that
<br>was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could
<br>remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt
<br>Petunia was how he had gotten it.
<br>
<br>"In the car crash when your parents died," she had said. "And don't ask
<br>questions."
<br>
<br>Don't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the
<br>Dursleys.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.
<br>
<br>"Comb your hair!" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.
<br>
<br>About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and
<br>shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts
<br>than the rest of the boys in his class put
<br>
<br>together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way --
<br>all over the place.
<br>
<br>Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his
<br>mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face,
<br>not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay
<br>smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley
<br>looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a
<br>pig in a wig.
<br>
<br>Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult
<br>as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents.
<br>His face fell.
<br>
<br>"Thirty-six," he said, looking up at his mother and father. "That's two
<br>less than last year."
<br>
<br>"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here
<br>under this big one from Mommy and Daddy."
<br>
<br>"All right, thirty-seven then," said Dudley, going red in the face.
<br>Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down
<br>his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.
<br>
<br>Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,
<br>"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's
<br>that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right''
<br>
<br>Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said
<br>slowly, "So I'll have thirty ... thirty..."
<br>
<br>"Thirty-nine, sweetums," said Aunt Petunia.
<br>
<br>"Oh." Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. "All right
<br>then."
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon chuckled. "Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like
<br>his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!" He ruffled Dudley's hair.
<br>
<br>At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it
<br>while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a
<br>video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and
<br>a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia
<br>came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.
<br>
<br>"Bad news, Vernon," she said. "Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't
<br>take him." She jerked her head in Harry's direction.
<br>
<br>Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every
<br>year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the
<br>day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every
<br>year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two
<br>streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage
<br>and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever
<br>owned.
<br>
<br>"Now what?" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd
<br>planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had
<br>broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be
<br>a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and
<br>Tufty again.
<br>
<br>"We could phone Marge," Uncle Vernon suggested.
<br>
<br>"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy."
<br>
<br>The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't
<br>there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't
<br>understand them, like a slug.
<br>
<br>"What about what's-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?"
<br>
<br>"On vacation in Majorca," snapped Aunt Petunia.
<br>
<br>"You could just leave me here," Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to
<br>watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go
<br>on Dudley's computer).
<br>
<br>Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon.
<br>
<br>"And come back and find the house in ruins?" she snarled.
<br>
<br>"I won't blow up the house," said Harry, but they weren't listening.
<br>
<br>"I suppose we could take him to the zoo," said Aunt Petunia slowly, "...
<br>and leave him in the car...."
<br>
<br>"That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone...."
<br>
<br>Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had
<br>been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up
<br>his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.
<br>
<br>"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special
<br>day!" she cried, flinging her arms around him.
<br>
<br>"I... don't... want... him... t-t-to come!" Dudley yelled between huge,
<br>pretend sobs. "He always sp- spoils everything!" He <b>shot</b>  Harry a nasty
<br>grin through the gap in his mother's arms.
<br>
<br>Just then, the doorbell rang -- "Oh, good Lord, they're here!" said Aunt
<br>Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers
<br>Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face
<br>like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their
<br>backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.
<br>
<br>Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in
<br>the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the
<br>zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able
<br>to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle
<br>Vernon had taken Harry aside.
<br>
<br>"I'm warning you," he had said, putting his large purple face right up
<br>close to Harry's, "I'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business,
<br>anything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now until
<br>Christmas."
<br>
<br>"I'm not going to do anything," said Harry, "honestly..
<br>
<br>But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did.
<br>
<br>The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was
<br>just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.
<br>
<br>Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking
<br>as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors
<br>and cut his hair so short he was <b>almost</b>  bald except for his bangs, which
<br>she left "to hide that horrible scar." Dudley had laughed himself silly
<br>at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day,
<br>where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.
<br>Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it
<br>had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week
<br>in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he
<br>couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.
<br>
<br>Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting
<br>old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she
<br>tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until
<br>finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit
<br>Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to
<br>his great relief, Harry wasn't punished.
<br>
<br>On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on
<br>the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as
<br>usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was
<br>sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter
<br>from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school
<br>buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon
<br>through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash
<br>cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have
<br>caught him in mid- jump.
<br>
<br>But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with
<br>Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school,
<br>his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room.
<br>
<br>While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to
<br>complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the
<br>bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning,
<br>it was motorcycles.
<br>
<br>"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums," he said, as a
<br>motorcycle overtook them.
<br>
<br>I had a dream about a motorcycle," said Harry, remembering suddenly. "It
<br>was flying."
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right
<br>around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet
<br>with a mustache: "MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!"
<br>
<br>Dudley and Piers sniggered.
<br>
<br>I know they don't," said Harry. "It was only a dream."
<br>
<br>But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the
<br>Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking
<br>about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a
<br>dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous
<br>ideas.
<br>
<br>It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The
<br>Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the
<br>entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry
<br>what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap
<br>lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they
<br>watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley,
<br>except that it wasn't blond.
<br>
<br>Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to
<br>walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who
<br>were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall
<br>back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo
<br>restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker
<br>glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him
<br>another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.
<br>
<br>Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to
<br>last.
<br>
<br>After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in
<br>there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts
<br>of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and
<br>stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick,
<br>man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the
<br>place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car
<br>and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in
<br>the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.
<br>
<br>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the
<br>glistening brown coils.
<br>
<br>"Make it move," he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the
<br>glass, but the snake didn't budge.
<br>
<br>"Do it again," Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly
<br>with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.
<br>
<br>"This is boring," Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.
<br>
<br>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He
<br>wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no
<br>company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying
<br>to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a
<br>bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door
<br>to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.
<br>
<br>The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised
<br>its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's.
<br>
<br>It winked.
<br>
<br>Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was
<br>watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.
<br>
<br>The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised
<br>its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:
<br>
<br>"I get that all the time.
<br>
<br>"I know," Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the
<br>snake could hear him. "It must be really annoying."
<br>
<br>The snake nodded vigorously.
<br>
<br>"Where do you come from, anyway?" Harry asked.
<br>
<br>The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry
<br>peered at it.
<br>
<br>Boa Constrictor, Brazil.
<br>
<br>"Was it nice there?"
<br>
<br>The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:
<br>This specimen was bred in the zoo. "Oh, I see -- so you've never been to
<br>Brazil?"
<br>
<br>As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of
<br>them jump.
<br>
<br>"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE
<br>WHAT IT'S DOING!"
<br>
<br>Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.
<br>
<br>"Out of the way, you," he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by
<br>surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened
<br>so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were
<br>leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with
<br>howls of horror.
<br>
<br>Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank
<br>had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering
<br>out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and
<br>started running for the exits.
<br>
<br>As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low,
<br>hissing voice said, "Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo."
<br>
<br>The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.
<br>
<br>"But the glass," he kept saying, "where did the glass go?"
<br>
<br>The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea
<br>while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only
<br>gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except
<br>snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were
<br>all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had
<br>nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to
<br>squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers
<br>calming down enough to say, "Harry was talking to it, weren't you,
<br>Harry?"
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before
<br>starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to
<br>say, "Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals," before he collapsed into a
<br>chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.
<br>
<br>Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He
<br>didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were
<br>asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk <b>sneaking</b>  to the kitchen
<br>for some food.
<br>
<br>He'd lived with the Dursleys <b>almost</b>  ten years, ten miserable years, as
<br>long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents
<br>had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when
<br>his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long
<br>hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding
<br>flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he
<br>supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green
<br>light came from. He couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and
<br>uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask
<br>questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.
<br>
<br>When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown
<br>relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the
<br>Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped)
<br>that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers
<br>they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once
<br>while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry
<br>furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the
<br>shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in
<br>green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long
<br>purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and
<br>then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these
<br>people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a
<br>closer look.
<br>
<br>At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated
<br>that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and
<br>nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER THREE
<br>
<br>THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE
<br>
<br>The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his
<br>longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard
<br>again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his
<br>new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time
<br>out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet
<br>Drive on her crutches.
<br>
<br>Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang,
<br>who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and
<br>Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and
<br>stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite
<br>happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.
<br>
<br>This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,
<br>wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he
<br>could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off
<br>to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be
<br>with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private
<br>school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the
<br>other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley
<br>thought this was very funny.
<br>
<br>"They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,"
<br>he told Harry. "Want to come upstairs and practice?"
<br>
<br>"No, thanks," said Harry. "The <b>poor</b>  toilet's never had anything as
<br>horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick." Then he ran, before
<br>Dudley could work out what he'd said.
<br>
<br>One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings
<br>uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn 't as bad as
<br>usual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats,
<br>and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch
<br>television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though
<br>she'd had it for several years.
<br>
<br>That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in
<br>his brand-new uniform. Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange
<br>knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried
<br>knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't
<br>looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.
<br>
<br>As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said
<br>gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst
<br>into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he
<br>looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He
<br>thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to
<br>laugh.
<br>
<br>There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry
<br>went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in
<br>the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like
<br>dirty rags swimming in gray water.
<br>
<br>"What's this?" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always
<br>did if he dared to ask a question.
<br>
<br>"Your new school uniform," she said.
<br>
<br>Harry looked in the bowl again.
<br>
<br>"Oh," he said, "I didn't realize it had to be so wet."
<br>
<br>"DotA be stupid," snapped Aunt Petunia. "I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old
<br>things gray for you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've
<br>finished."
<br>
<br>Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat
<br>down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look
<br>on his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of old
<br>elephant skin, probably.
<br>
<br>Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the
<br>smell from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as
<br>usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere,
<br>on the table.
<br>
<br>They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the
<br>doormat.
<br>
<br>"Get the mail, Dudley," said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.
<br>
<br>"Make Harry get it."
<br>
<br>"Get the mail, Harry."
<br>
<br>"Make Dudley get it."
<br>
<br>"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley."
<br>
<br>Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things
<br>lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was
<br>vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a
<br>bill, and -- a letter for Harry.
<br>
<br>Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant
<br>elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who
<br>would? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the
<br>library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet
<br>here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:
<br>
<br>Mr. H. Potter
<br>
<br>The Cupboard under the Stairs
<br>
<br>4 Privet Drive
<br>
<br>Little Whinging
<br>
<br>Surrey
<br>
<br>The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the
<br>address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.
<br>
<br>Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax
<br>seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake
<br>surrounding a large letter H.
<br>
<br>"Hurry up, boy!" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. "What are you
<br>doing, checking for letter bombs?" He chuckled at his own joke.
<br>
<br>Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed
<br>Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to
<br>open the yellow envelope.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over
<br>the postcard.
<br>
<br>"Marge's ill," he informed Aunt Petunia. "Ate a funny whelk. --."
<br>
<br>"Dad!" said Dudley suddenly. "Dad, Harry's got something!"
<br>
<br>Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the
<br>same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of
<br>his hand by Uncle Vernon.
<br>
<br>"That's mine!" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.
<br>
<br>"Who'd be writing to you?" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open
<br>with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster
<br>than a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds
<br>it was the grayish white of old porridge.
<br>
<br>"P-P-Petunia!" he gasped.
<br>
<br>Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it
<br>high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first
<br>line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her
<br>throat and made a choking noise.
<br>
<br>"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!"
<br>
<br>They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and
<br>Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He
<br>gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.
<br>
<br>"I want to read that letter," he said loudly. want to read it," said
<br>Harry furiously, "as it's mine."
<br>
<br>"Get out, both of you," croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back
<br>inside its envelope.
<br>
<br>Harry didn't move.
<br>
<br>I WANT MY LETTER!" he shouted.
<br>
<br>"Let me see it!" demanded Dudley.
<br>
<br>"OUT!" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the
<br>scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the
<br>kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but
<br>silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry,
<br>his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at
<br>the crack between door and floor.
<br>
<br>"Vernon," Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, "look at the
<br>address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think
<br>they're watching the house?"
<br>
<br>"Watching -- spying -- might be following us," muttered Uncle Vernon
<br>wildly.
<br>
<br>"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don't
<br>want --"
<br>
<br>Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the
<br>kitchen.
<br>
<br>"No," he said finally. "No, we'll ignore it. If they don't get an
<br>answer... Yes, that's best... we won't do anything....
<br>
<br>"But --"
<br>
<br>"I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took
<br>him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?"
<br>
<br>That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd
<br>never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.
<br>
<br>"Where's my letter?" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed
<br>through the door. "Who's writing to me?"
<br>
<br>"No one. it was addressed to you by mistake," said Uncle Vernon shortly.
<br>"I have burned it."
<br>
<br>"It was not a mistake," said Harry angrily, "it had my cupboard on it."
<br>
<br>"SILENCE!" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the
<br>ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a
<br>smile, which looked quite painful.
<br>
<br>"Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been
<br>thinking... you're really getting a bit big for it... we think it might
<br>be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom.
<br>
<br>"Why?" said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Don't ask questions!" snapped his uncle. "Take this stuff upstairs,
<br>now."
<br>
<br>The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt
<br>Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one
<br>where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things
<br>that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip
<br>upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He
<br>sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was
<br>broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working
<br>tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the
<br>corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot
<br>through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large
<br>birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school
<br>for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent
<br>because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They
<br>were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been
<br>touched.
<br>
<br>From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don't
<br>want him in there... I need that room... make him get out...."
<br>
<br>Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given
<br>anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with
<br>that letter than up here without it.
<br>
<br>Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in
<br>shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been
<br>sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the
<br>greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was
<br>thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the
<br>letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each
<br>other darkly.
<br>
<br>When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice
<br>to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with
<br>his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, "There's
<br>another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --'"
<br>
<br>With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the
<br>hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the
<br>ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact
<br>that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a
<br>minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the
<br>Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with
<br>Harry's letter clutched in his hand.
<br>
<br>"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom," he wheezed at Harry.
<br>"Dudley -- go -- just go."
<br>
<br>Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out
<br>of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first
<br>letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure
<br>they didn't fail. He had a plan.
<br>
<br>The repaired alarm clock rang at six o'clock the next morning. Harry
<br>turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the
<br>Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.
<br>
<br>He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and
<br>get the letters for <b>number</b>  four first. His heart hammered as he crept
<br>across the dark hall toward the front door --
<br>
<br>Harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on
<br>the doormat -- something alive!
<br>
<br>Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the
<br>big, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been
<br>lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making
<br>sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He
<br>shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make
<br>a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the
<br>time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.
<br>Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.
<br>
<br>I want --" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into
<br>pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He
<br>stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.
<br>
<br>"See," he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, "if
<br>they can't deliver them they'll just give up."
<br>
<br>"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon."
<br>
<br>"Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not
<br>like you and me," said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the
<br>piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.
<br>
<br>On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they
<br>couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door,
<br>slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small
<br>window in the downstairs bathroom.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got
<br>out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and
<br>back doors so no one could go out. He hummed "Tiptoe Through the Tulips"
<br>as he worked, and jumped at small noises.
<br>
<br>On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to
<br>Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each
<br>of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt
<br>Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious
<br>telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone
<br>to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.
<br>
<br>"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?" Dudley asked Harry in
<br>amazement.
<br>
<br>On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking
<br>tired and rather ill, but happy.
<br>
<br>"No post on Sundays," he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade
<br>on his newspapers, "no damn letters today --"
<br>
<br>Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught
<br>him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty
<br>letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys
<br>ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one.
<br>
<br>"Out! OUT!"
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.
<br>When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their
<br>faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters
<br>still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.
<br>
<br>"That does it," said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling
<br>great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back
<br>here in five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some
<br>clothes. No arguments!"
<br>
<br>He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared
<br>argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the
<br>boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway.
<br>Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the
<br>head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and
<br>computer in his sports bag.
<br>
<br>They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they
<br>were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and
<br>drive in the opposite direction for a while. "Shake'em off... shake 'em
<br>off," he would mutter whenever he did this.
<br>
<br>They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was
<br>howling. He'd never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he'd
<br>missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone
<br>so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the
<br>outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds
<br>and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on
<br>the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and
<br>wondering....
<br>
<br>They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for
<br>breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the
<br>hotel came over to their table.
<br>
<br>"'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred
<br>of these at the front desk."
<br>
<br>She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:
<br>
<br>Mr. H. Potter
<br>
<br>Room 17
<br>
<br>Railview Hotel
<br>
<br>Cokeworth
<br>
<br>Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out
<br>of the way. The woman stared.
<br>
<br>"I'll take them," said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following
<br>her from the dining room.
<br>
<br>Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?" Aunt Petunia suggested
<br>timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly
<br>what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the
<br>middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in
<br>the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle
<br>of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of
<br>a multilevel parking garage.
<br>
<br>"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that
<br>afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside
<br>the car, and disappeared.
<br>
<br>It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley
<br>sniveled.
<br>
<br>"It's Monday," he told his mother. "The Great Humberto's on tonight. I
<br>want to stay somewhere with a television. "
<br>
<br>Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you
<br>could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of
<br>television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of
<br>course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys
<br>had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.
<br>Still, you weren't eleven every day.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long,
<br>thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd
<br>bought.
<br>
<br>"Found the perfect place!" he said. "Come on! Everyone out!"
<br>
<br>It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what
<br>looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was
<br>the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was
<br>certain, there was no television in there.
<br>
<br>"Storm forecast for tonight!" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his
<br>hands together. "And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his
<br>boat!"
<br>
<br>A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather
<br>wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below
<br>them.
<br>
<br>"I've already got us some rations," said Uncle Vernon, "so all aboard!"
<br>
<br>It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their
<br>necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like
<br>hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding,
<br>led the way to the broken-down house.
<br>
<br>The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind
<br>whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was
<br>damp and empty. There were only two rooms.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four
<br>bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked
<br>and shriveled up.
<br>
<br>"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?" he said cheerfully.
<br>
<br>He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance
<br>of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately
<br>agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.
<br>
<br>As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the
<br>high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the
<br>filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second
<br>room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle
<br>Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find
<br>the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest,
<br>most ragged blanket.
<br>
<br>The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry
<br>couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable,
<br>his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the
<br>low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of
<br>Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat
<br>wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. He lay and
<br>watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would
<br>remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.
<br>
<br>Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the
<br>roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did.
<br>Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of
<br>letters when they got back that he'd be able to <b>steal</b>  one somehow.
<br>
<br>Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like
<br>that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was
<br>the rock crumbling into the sea?
<br>
<br>One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty ... ten...
<br>nine -- maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three... two...
<br>one...
<br>
<br>BOOM.
<br>
<br>The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the
<br>door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER FOUR
<br>
<br>THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS
<br>
<br>BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. "Where's the cannon?" he
<br>said stupidly.
<br>
<br>There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the
<br>room. He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had been
<br>in the long, thin package he had brought with them.
<br>
<br>"Who's there?" he shouted. "I warn you -- I'm armed!"
<br>
<br>There was a pause. Then --
<br>
<br>SMASH!
<br>
<br>The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and
<br>with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.
<br>
<br>A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was <b>almost</b> 
<br>completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled
<br>beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles
<br>under all the hair.
<br>
<br>The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just
<br>brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it
<br>easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a
<br>little. He turned to look at them all.
<br>
<br>"Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been an easy
<br>journey..."
<br>
<br>He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.
<br>
<br>"Budge up, yeh great lump," said the stranger.
<br>
<br>Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching,
<br>terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.
<br>
<br>"An' here's Harry!" said the giant.
<br>
<br>Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the
<br>beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.
<br>
<br>"Las' time I saw you, you was only a baby," said the giant. "Yeh look a
<br>lot like yet dad, but yeh've got yet mom's eyes."
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.
<br>
<br>I demand that you leave at once, sit!" he said. "You are breaking and
<br>entering!"
<br>
<br>"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune," said the giant; he reached over
<br>the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent
<br>it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it
<br>into a corner of the room.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.
<br>
<br>"Anyway -- Harry," said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, "a
<br>very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat on
<br>it at some point, but it'll taste all right."
<br>
<br>From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly
<br>squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a
<br>large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in
<br>green icing.
<br>
<br>Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words
<br>got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, "Who are
<br>you?"
<br>
<br>The giant chuckled.
<br>
<br>"True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and
<br>Grounds at Hogwarts."
<br>
<br>He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm.
<br>
<br>"What about that tea then, eh?" he said, rubbing his hands together.
<br>"I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind."
<br>
<br>His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and
<br>he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he
<br>was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire
<br>there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt
<br>the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath.
<br>
<br>The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and
<br>began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a
<br>copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several
<br>chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from
<br>before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and
<br>smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was
<br>working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt
<br>sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said
<br>sharply, "Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley."
<br>
<br>The giant chuckled darkly.
<br>
<br>"Yet great puddin' of a son don' need fattenin' anymore, Dursley, don'
<br>worry."
<br>
<br>He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted
<br>anything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off the
<br>giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said,
<br>"I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are."
<br>
<br>The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his
<br>hand.
<br>
<br>"Call me Hagrid," he said, "everyone does. An' like I told yeh, I'm
<br>Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course.
<br>
<br>"Er -- no," said Harry.
<br>
<br>Hagrid looked shocked.
<br>
<br>"Sorry," Harry said quickly.
<br>
<br>"Sony?" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back
<br>into the shadows. "It' s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren't
<br>gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou'
<br>Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents
<br>learned it all?"
<br>
<br>"All what?" asked Harry.
<br>
<br>"ALL WHAT?" Hagrid thundered. "Now wait jus' one second!"
<br>
<br>He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut.
<br>The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.
<br>
<br>"Do you mean ter tell me," he growled at the Dursleys, "that this boy --
<br>this boy! -- knows nothin' abou' -- about ANYTHING?"
<br>
<br>Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after
<br>all, and his marks weren't bad.
<br>
<br>"I know some things," he said. "I can, you know, do math and stuff." But
<br>Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, "About our world, I mean. Your
<br>world. My world. Yer parents' world."
<br>
<br>"What world?"
<br>
<br>Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.
<br>
<br>"DURSLEY!" he boomed.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded
<br>like "Mimblewimble." Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.
<br>
<br>"But yeh must know about yet mom and dad," he said. "I mean, they're
<br>famous. You're famous."
<br>
<br>"What? My -- my mom and dad weren't famous, were they?"
<br>
<br>"Yeh don' know... yeh don' know..." Hagrid ran his fingers through his
<br>hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.
<br>
<br>"Yeh don' know what yeh are?" he said finally.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.
<br>
<br>"Stop!" he commanded. "Stop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the
<br>boy anything!"
<br>
<br>A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious
<br>look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled
<br>with rage.
<br>
<br>"You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore
<br>left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An'
<br>you've kept it from him all these years?"
<br>
<br>"Kept what from me?" said Harry eagerly.
<br>
<br>"STOP! I FORBID YOU!" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.
<br>
<br>Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.
<br>
<br>"Ah, go boil yet heads, both of yeh," said Hagrid. "Harry -- yet a
<br>wizard."
<br>
<br>There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind
<br>could be heard.
<br>
<br>"-- a what?" gasped Harry.
<br>
<br>"A wizard, o' course," said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which
<br>groaned and sank even lower, "an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once
<br>yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else
<br>would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter."
<br>
<br>Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope,
<br>addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock,
<br>The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:
<br>
<br>HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY
<br>
<br>Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
<br>
<br>(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme
<br>Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)
<br>
<br>Dear Mr. Potter,
<br>
<br>We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts
<br>School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all
<br>necessary books and equipment.
<br>
<br>Term begins on September 1. We <b>await</b>  your owl by no later than July 31.
<br>Yours sincerely,
<br>
<br>Minerva McGonagall,
<br>
<br>Deputy Headmistress
<br>
<br>Questions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't
<br>decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, "What does
<br>it mean, they <b>await</b>  my owl?"
<br>
<br>"Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me," said Hagrid, clapping a hand to
<br>his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet
<br>another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live,
<br>rather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment.
<br>With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could
<br>read upside down:
<br>
<br>Dear Professor Dumbledore,
<br>
<br>Given Harry his letter.
<br>
<br>Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.
<br>
<br>Weather's horrible. <b>Hope</b>  you're Well.
<br>
<br>Hagrid
<br>
<br>Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its
<br>beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he
<br>came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the
<br>telephone.
<br>
<br>Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.
<br>
<br>"Where was I?" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still
<br>ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.
<br>
<br>"He's not going," he said.
<br>
<br>Hagrid grunted.
<br>
<br>"I'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him," he said.
<br>
<br>"A what?" said Harry, interested.
<br>
<br>"A Muggle," said Hagrid, "it's what we call nonmagic folk like thern.
<br>An' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest Muggles I
<br>ever laid eyes on."
<br>
<br>"We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish," said
<br>Uncle Vernon, "swore we'd stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!"
<br>
<br>"You knew?" said Harry. "You knew I'm a -- a wizard?"
<br>
<br>"Knew!" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. "Knew! Of course we knew! How
<br>could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a
<br>letter just like that and disappeared off to that-that school-and came
<br>home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups
<br>into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak!
<br>But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that,
<br>they were proud of having a witch in the family!"
<br>
<br>She stopped to <b>draw</b>  a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed
<br>she had been wanting to say all this for years.
<br>
<br>"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and
<br>had you, and of course I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange,
<br>just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went and got
<br>herself blown up and we got landed with you!"
<br>
<br>Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, "Blown
<br>up? You told me they died in a car crash!"
<br>
<br>"CAR CRASH!" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys
<br>scuttled back to their corner. "How could a car crash kill Lily an'
<br>James Potter? It's an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin' his
<br>own story when every kid in our world knows his name!" "But why? What
<br>happened?" Harry asked urgently.
<br>
<br>The anger faded from Hagrid's face. He looked suddenly anxious.
<br>
<br>"I never expected this," he said, in a low, worried voice. "I had no
<br>idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin' hold of
<br>yeh, how much yeh didn't know. Ah, Harry, I don' know if I'm the right
<br>person ter tell yeh -- but someone 3 s gotta -- yeh can't go off ter
<br>Hogwarts not knowin'."
<br>
<br>He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.
<br>
<br>"Well, it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind, I can't
<br>tell yeh everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it...."
<br>
<br>He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, "It
<br>begins, I suppose, with -- with a person called -- but it's incredible
<br>yeh don't know his name, everyone in our world knows --"
<br>
<br>"Who? "
<br>
<br>"Well -- I don' like sayin' the name if I can help it. No one does."
<br>
<br>"Why not?"
<br>
<br>"Gulpin' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is
<br>difficult. See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you
<br>could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was..."
<br>
<br>Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.
<br>
<br>"Could you write it down?" Harry suggested.
<br>
<br>"Nah -can't <b>spell</b>  it. All right -- Voldemort. " Hagrid shuddered. "Don'
<br>make me say it again. Anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years
<br>ago now, started lookin' fer followers. Got 'em, too -- some were
<br>afraid, some just wanted a bit o' his power, 'cause he was gettin'
<br>himself power, all right. <b>Dark</b>  days, Harry. Didn't know who ter trust,
<br>didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible
<br>things happened. He was takin' over. 'Course, some stood up to him --
<br>an' he killed 'em. Horribly. One o' the only safe places left was
<br>Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of.
<br>Didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway.
<br>
<br>"Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew.
<br>Head boy an' girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst'ry is why
<br>You-Know-Who never tried to get 'em on his side before... probably knew
<br>they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do with the
<br><b>Dark</b>  Side.
<br>
<br>"Maybe he thought he could persuade 'em... maybe he just wanted 'em
<br>outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where
<br>you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old.
<br>He came ter yer house an' -- an' --"
<br>
<br>Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted <b>handkerchief</b>  and blew
<br>his nose with a sound like a foghorn.
<br>
<br>"Sorry," he said. "But it's that sad -- knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer
<br>people yeh couldn't find -- anyway..."
<br>
<br>"You-Know-Who killed 'em. An' then -- an' this is the real myst'ry of
<br>the thing -- he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of
<br>it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then. But he couldn't
<br>do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no
<br>ordinary cut. That's what yeh get when a Powerful, evil curse touches
<br>yeh -- took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even -- but it didn't
<br>work on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after
<br>he decided ter kill 'em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some o' the
<br>best witches an' wizards of the age -- the McKinnons, the Bones, the
<br>Prewetts -- an' you was only a baby, an' you lived."
<br>
<br>Something very painful was going on in Harry's mind. As Hagrid's story
<br>came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more
<br>clearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he remembered
<br>something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel
<br>laugh.
<br>
<br>Hagrid was watching him <b>sadly</b> .
<br>
<br>"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore's orders. Brought
<br>yeh ter this lot..."
<br>
<br>"Load of old tosh," said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had <b>almost</b> 
<br>forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to
<br>have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were
<br>clenched.
<br>
<br>"Now, you listen here, boy," he snarled, "I accept there's something
<br>strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured
<br>-- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no
<br>denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion --
<br>asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types --
<br>just what I expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end --"
<br>
<br>But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink
<br>umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a
<br>sword, he said, "I'm warning you, Dursley -I'm warning you -- one more
<br>word... "
<br>
<br>In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant,
<br>Uncle Vernon's courage failed again; he flattened himself against the
<br>wall and fell silent.
<br>
<br>"That's better," said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on
<br>the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.
<br>
<br>Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.
<br>
<br>"But what happened to Vol--, sorry -- I mean, You-Know-Who?"
<br>
<br>"Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter
<br>kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That's the biggest myst'ry, see...
<br>he was gettin' more an' more powerful -- why'd he go?
<br>
<br>"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough
<br>human left in him to die. Some say he's still out there, bidin' his
<br>time, like, but I don' believe it. People who was on his side came back
<br>ter ours. Some of 'em came outta kinda trances. Don~ reckon they
<br>could've done if he was comin' back.
<br>
<br>"Most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers.
<br>Too weak to carry on. 'Cause somethin' about you finished him, Harry.
<br>There was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't counted on -- I dunno
<br>what it was, no one does -- but somethin' about you stumped him, all
<br>right."
<br>
<br>Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but
<br>Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had
<br>been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He'd
<br>spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and
<br>Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn't they been turned
<br>into warty toads every time they'd tried to lock him in his cupboard? If
<br>he'd once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley
<br>had always been able to kick him around like a football?
<br>
<br>"Hagrid," he said quietly, "I think you must have made a mistake. I
<br>don't think I can be a wizard."
<br>
<br>To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.
<br>
<br>"Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or
<br>angry?"
<br>
<br>Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it... every odd
<br>thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had
<br>happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudley's
<br>gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going
<br>to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow
<br>back... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his
<br>revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn't he set a boa
<br>constrictor on him?
<br>
<br>Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively
<br>beaming at him.
<br>
<br>"See?" said Hagrid. "Harry Potter, not a wizard -- you wait, you'll be
<br>right famous at Hogwarts."
<br>
<br>But Uncle Vernon wasn't going to give in without a fight.
<br>
<br>"Haven't I told you he's not going?" he hissed. "He's going to Stonewall
<br>High and he'll be grateful for it. I've read those letters and he needs
<br>all sorts of rubbish -- <b>spell</b>  books and wands and --"
<br>
<br>"If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won't stop him," growled
<br>Hagrid. "Stop Lily an' James Potter' s son goin' ter Hogwarts! Yer mad.
<br>His name's been down ever since he was born. He's off ter the finest
<br>school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he
<br>won't know himself. He'll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a
<br>change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had
<br>Albus Dumbled--"
<br>
<br>"I AM <b>NOT</b>  PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!"
<br>yelled Uncle Vernon.
<br>
<br>But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled
<br>it over his head, "NEVER," he thundered, "- INSULT- ALBUS- DUMBLEDORE-
<br>IN- FRONT- OF- ME!"
<br>
<br>He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley
<br>-- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a
<br>sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with
<br>his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned
<br>his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in
<br>his trousers.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other
<br>room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door
<br>behind them.
<br>
<br>Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.
<br>
<br>"Shouldn'ta lost me temper," he said ruefully, "but it didn't work
<br>anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like
<br>a pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do."
<br>
<br>He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.
<br>
<br>"Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts," he
<br>said. "I'm -- er -- not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'. I was
<br>allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff
<br>-- one o' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job
<br>
<br>"Why aren't you supposed to do magic?" asked Harry.
<br>
<br>"Oh, well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, ter
<br>tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an'
<br>everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man,
<br>Dumbledore." "Why were you expelled?"
<br>
<br>"It's gettin' late and we've got lots ter do tomorrow," said Hagrid
<br>loudly. "Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that."
<br>
<br>He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.
<br>
<br>"You can kip under that," he said. "Don' mind if it wriggles a bit, I
<br>think I still got a couple o' dormice in one o' the pockets."
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER FIVE
<br>
<br>DIAGON ALLEY
<br>
<br>Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was
<br>daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.
<br>
<br>"It was a dream, he told himself firmly. "I dreamed a giant called
<br>Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open
<br>my eyes I'll be at home in my cupboard."
<br>
<br>There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.
<br>
<br>And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart
<br>sinking. But he still didn't open his eyes. It had been such a good
<br>dream.
<br>
<br>Tap. Tap. Tap.
<br>
<br>"All right," Harry mumbled, "I'm getting up."
<br>
<br>He sat up and Hagrid's heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of
<br>sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed
<br>sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper
<br>held in its beak.
<br>
<br>Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon
<br>was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it
<br>open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who
<br>didn't wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to
<br>attack Hagrid's coat.
<br>
<br>"Don't do that."
<br>
<br>Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak
<br>fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.
<br>
<br>"Hagrid!" said Harry loudly. "There's an owl
<br>
<br>"Pay him," Hagrid grunted into the sofa.
<br>
<br>"What?"
<br>
<br>"He wants payin' fer deliverin' the paper. Look in the pockets."
<br>Hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of
<br>keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...
<br>finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.
<br>
<br>"Give him five Knuts," said Hagrid sleepily.
<br>
<br>"Knuts?"
<br>
<br>"The little bronze ones."
<br>
<br>Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg
<br>so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then
<br>he flew off through the open window.
<br>
<br>Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.
<br>
<br>"Best be Off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an' buy
<br>all yer stuff fer school."
<br>
<br>Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just
<br>thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon
<br>inside him had got a puncture.
<br>
<br>"Um -- Hagrid?"
<br>
<br>"Mm?" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.
<br>
<br>"I haven't got any money -- and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ... he
<br>won't pay for me to go and learn magic."
<br>
<br>"Don't worry about that," said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his
<br>head. "D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?"
<br>
<br>"But if their house was destroyed --"
<br>
<br>"They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is
<br>Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have a sausage, they're not bad cold -- an' I
<br>wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither."
<br>
<br>"Wizards have banks?"
<br>
<br>"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins."
<br>
<br>Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.
<br>
<br>"Goblins?"
<br>
<br>"Yeah -- so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never
<br>mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer
<br>anything yeh want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o'
<br>fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts
<br>business." Hagrid drew himself up proudly. "He usually gets me ter do
<br>important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you gettin' things from Gringotts --
<br>knows he can trust me, see.
<br>
<br>"Got everythin'? Come on, then."
<br>
<br>Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and
<br>the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was
<br>still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.
<br>
<br>"How did you get here?" Harry asked, looking around for another boat.
<br>"Flew," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>"Flew?"
<br>
<br>"Yeah -- but we'll go back in this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've
<br>got yeh."
<br>
<br>They <b>settled</b>  down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to
<br>imagine him flying.
<br>
<br>"Seems a shame ter row, though," said Hagrid, giving Harry another of
<br>his sideways looks. "If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would
<br>yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?"
<br>
<br>"Of course not," said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out
<br>the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and
<br>they sped off toward land.
<br>
<br>"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?" Harry asked.
<br>
<br>"Spells -- enchantments," said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he
<br>spoke. "They say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults. And
<br>then yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under
<br>London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter
<br>get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat."
<br>
<br>Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the
<br>Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to
<br>be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never
<br>had so many questions in his life.
<br>
<br>"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual," Hagrid muttered, turning
<br>the page.
<br>
<br>"There's a Ministry of Magic?" Harry asked, before he could stop
<br>himself.
<br>
<br>"'Course," said Hagrid. "They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, 0 '
<br>course, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the
<br>job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls
<br>every morning, askin' fer advice."
<br>
<br>"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?"
<br>
<br>"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still
<br>witches an' wizards up an' down the country."
<br>
<br>"Why?"
<br>
<br>"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their
<br>problems. Nah, we're best left alone."
<br>
<br>At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid
<br>folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the
<br>street.
<br>
<br>Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town
<br>to the station. Harry couldn't blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as
<br>tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like
<br>parking meters and saying loudly, "See that, Harry? Things these Muggles
<br>dream up, eh?"
<br>
<br>"Hagrid," said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, "did you say
<br>there are dragons at Gringotts?"
<br>
<br>"Well, so they say," said Hagrid. "Crikey, I'd like a dragon."
<br>
<br>"You'd like one?"
<br>
<br>"Wanted one ever since I was a kid -- here we go."
<br>
<br>They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five
<br>minutes' time. Hagrid, who didn't understand "Muggle money," as he
<br>called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.
<br>
<br>People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and
<br>sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.
<br>
<br>"Still got yer letter, Harry?" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry
<br>took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.
<br>
<br>"Good," said Hagrid. "There's a list there of everything yeh need."
<br>
<br>Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night
<br>before, and read:

<br>
<br>"Can we buy all this in London?" Harry wondered aloud.
<br>
<br>"If yeh know where to go," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know
<br>where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an
<br>ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and
<br>complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.
<br>
<br>"I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic," he said as they
<br>climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined
<br>with shops.
<br>
<br>Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do
<br>was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores,
<br>hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it
<br>could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of
<br>ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles
<br>beneath them? Were there really shops that sold <b>spell</b>  books and
<br>broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had
<br>cooked up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of
<br>humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything
<br>Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help
<br>trusting him.
<br>
<br>"This is it," said Hagrid, coming to a halt, "the Leaky Cauldron. It's a
<br>famous place."
<br>
<br>It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out,
<br>Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't
<br>glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the
<br>record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at
<br>all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and
<br>Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered
<br>him inside.
<br>
<br>For a famous place, it was very dark and <b>shabby</b> . A few old women were
<br>sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was
<br>smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old
<br>bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The
<br>low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know
<br>Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a
<br>glass, saying, "The usual, Hagrid?"
<br>
<br>"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business," said Hagrid, clapping his great
<br>hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.
<br>
<br>
<br>"Good Lord," said the bartender, peering at Harry, "is this -- can this
<br>be --?"
<br>
<br>
<br>The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.
<br>
<br>"Bless my soul," whispered the old bartender, "Harry Potter... what an
<br>honor."
<br>
<br>He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his
<br>hand, tears in his eyes.
<br>
<br>"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back."
<br>
<br>Harry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old
<br>woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out.
<br>Hagrid was beaming.
<br>
<br>Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry
<br>found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.
<br>
<br>"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last."
<br>
<br>"So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud."
<br>
<br>"Always wanted to shake your hand -- I'm all of a flutter."
<br>
<br>"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus
<br>Diggle."
<br>
<br>"I've seen you before!" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off
<br>in his excitement. "You bowed to me once in a shop."
<br>
<br>"He remembers!" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. "Did
<br>you hear that? He remembers me!" Harry shook hands again and again --
<br>Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.
<br>
<br>A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes
<br>was twitching.
<br>
<br>"Professor Quirrell!" said Hagrid. "Harry, Professor Quirrell will be
<br>one of your teachers at Hogwarts."
<br>
<br>"P-P-Potter," stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand,
<br>"c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you."
<br>
<br>"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?"
<br>
<br>"D-Defense <b>Against</b>  the D-D-<b>Dark</b>  Arts," muttered Professor Quirrell, as
<br>though he'd rather not think about it. "N-not that you n-need it, eh,
<br>P-P-Potter?" He laughed nervously. "You'll be g-getting all your
<br>equipment, I suppose? I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires,
<br>m-myself." He looked terrified at the very thought.
<br>
<br>But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It
<br>took <b>almost</b>  ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid
<br>managed to make himself heard over the babble.
<br>
<br>"Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry."
<br>
<br>Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them
<br>through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was
<br>nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.
<br>
<br>Hagrid grinned at Harry.
<br>
<br>"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell
<br>was tremblin' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he's usually tremblin'."
<br>
<br>"Is he always that nervous?"
<br>
<br>"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was
<br>
<br>studyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand
<br>experience.... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there
<br>was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since.
<br>Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where's me
<br>umbrella?"
<br>
<br>Vampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was
<br>counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.
<br>
<br>"Three up... two across he muttered. "Right, stand back, Harry."
<br>
<br>He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.
<br>
<br>The brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a
<br>small hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they
<br>were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a
<br>cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
<br>
<br>"Welcome," said Hagrid, "to Diagon Alley."
<br>
<br>He grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry
<br>looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly
<br>back into solid wall.
<br>
<br>The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.
<br>Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring
<br>-- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.
<br>
<br>"Yeah, you'll be needin' one," said Hagrid, "but we gotta get yer money
<br>first."
<br>
<br>Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every
<br>direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at
<br>once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their
<br>shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as
<br>they passed, saying, "Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're
<br>mad...."
<br>
<br>A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl
<br>Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of
<br>about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with
<br>broomsticks in it. "Look," Harry heard one of them say, "the new Nimbus
<br>Two Thousand -- fastest ever --" There were shops selling robes, shops
<br>selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen
<br>before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes,
<br>tottering piles of <b>spell</b>  books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion
<br>bottles, globes of the moon....
<br>
<br>"Gringotts," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other
<br>little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a
<br>uniform of scarlet and gold, was -
<br>
<br>"Yeah, that's a goblin," said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white
<br>stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.
<br>He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very
<br>long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were
<br>facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved
<br>upon them:
<br>
<br>Enter, stranger, but take heed
<br>
<br>Of what awaits the sin of greed,
<br>
<br>For those who take, but do not earn,
<br>
<br>Must pay most dearly in their turn.
<br>
<br>So if you seek beneath our floors
<br>
<br>A treasure that was never yours,
<br>
<br>Thief, you have been warned, beware
<br>
<br>Of finding more than treasure there.
<br>
<br>"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a
<br>vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high
<br>stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing
<br>coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.
<br>There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more
<br>goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made
<br>for the counter.
<br>
<br>"Morning," said Hagrid to a free goblin. "We've come ter take some money
<br>outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe."
<br>
<br>"You have his key, Sir?"
<br>
<br>"Got it here somewhere," said Hagrid, and he started emptying his
<br>pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits
<br>over the goblin's book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry
<br>watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as
<br>glowing coals.
<br>
<br>"Got it," said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.
<br>
<br>The goblin looked at it closely.
<br>
<br>"That seems to be in order."
<br>
<br>"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore," said Hagrid
<br>importantly, throwing out his chest. "It's about the YouKnow-What in
<br>vault seven hundred and thirteen."
<br>
<br>The goblin read the letter carefully.
<br>
<br>"Very well," he said, handing it back to Hagrid, "I will have Someone
<br>take you down to both vaults. Griphook!"
<br>
<br>Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog
<br>biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward
<br>one of the doors leading off the hall.
<br>
<br>"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?" Harry
<br>asked.
<br>
<br>"Can't tell yeh that," said Hagrid mysteriously. "Very secret. Hogwarts
<br>business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh
<br>that."
<br>
<br>Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more
<br>marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with
<br>flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little
<br>railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came
<br>hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some
<br>difficulty -- and were off.
<br>
<br>At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry
<br>tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left,
<br>but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way,
<br>because Griphook wasn't steering.
<br>
<br>Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them
<br>wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a
<br>passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - -
<br>they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge
<br>stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.
<br>
<br>I never know," Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart,
<br>"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?"
<br>
<br>"Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it," said Hagrid. "An' don' ask me questions
<br>just now, I think I'm gonna be sick."
<br>
<br>He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small
<br>door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the
<br>wall to stop his knees from trembling.
<br>
<br>Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and
<br>as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns
<br>of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.
<br>
<br>"All yours," smiled Hagrid.
<br>
<br>All Harry's -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about
<br>this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had
<br>they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there
<br>had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.
<br>
<br>Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.
<br>
<br>"The gold ones are Galleons," he explained. "Seventeen silver Sickles to
<br>a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough. Right,
<br>that should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe
<br>for yeh." He turned to Griphook. "Vault seven hundred and thirteen now,
<br>please, and can we go more slowly?"
<br>
<br>"One speed only," said Griphook.
<br>
<br>They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became
<br>colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went
<br>rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to
<br>try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and
<br>pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.
<br>
<br>Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.
<br>
<br>"Stand back," said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with
<br>one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.
<br>
<br>"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through
<br>the door and trapped in there," said Griphook.
<br>
<br>"How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?" Harry asked.
<br>
<br>"About once every ten years," said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.
<br>
<br>Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,
<br>Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, <b>expecting</b>  to see fabulous
<br>jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. Then
<br>he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on
<br>the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry
<br>longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.
<br>
<br>"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way
<br>back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside
<br>Gringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag
<br>full of money. He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a
<br>pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole
<br>life -- more money than even Dudley had ever had.
<br>
<br>"Might as well get yer uniform," said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam
<br>Malkin's Robes for All Occasions. "Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I
<br>slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them
<br>Gringotts carts." He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam
<br>Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous.
<br>
<br>Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.
<br>
<br>"Hogwarts, clear?" she said, when Harry started to speak. "Got the lot
<br>here -- another young man being fitted up just now, in fact. "
<br>
<br>In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on
<br>a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam
<br>Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his
<br>head, and began to pin it to the right length.
<br>
<br>"Hello," said the boy, "Hogwarts, too?"
<br>
<br>"Yes," said Harry.
<br>
<br>"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street
<br>looking at wands," said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. "Then
<br>I'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don't see why
<br>first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting
<br>me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow."
<br>
<br>Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.
<br>
<br>"Have you got your own broom?" the boy went on.
<br>
<br>"No," said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Play Quidditch at all?"
<br>
<br>"No," Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.
<br>
<br>"I do -- Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my
<br>house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?"
<br>
<br>"No," said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.
<br>
<br>"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know
<br>I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in
<br>Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?" "Mmm," said Harry, wishing
<br>he could say something a bit more interesting.
<br>
<br>"I say, look at that man!" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the
<br>front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing
<br>at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in.
<br>
<br>"That's Hagrid," said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't.
<br>"He works at Hogwarts."
<br>
<br>"Oh," said the boy, "I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, <b>isn</b> 't
<br>he?"
<br>
<br>"He's the gamekeeper," said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less
<br>every second.
<br>
<br>"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the
<br>school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic,
<br>and ends up setting fire to his bed."
<br>
<br>"I think he's brilliant," said Harry coldly.
<br>
<br>"Do you?" said the boy, with a slight sneer. "Why is he with you? Where
<br>are your parents?"
<br>
<br>"They're dead," said Harry shortly. He didn't feel much like going into
<br>the matter with this boy.
<br>
<br>"Oh, sorry," said the other,. not sounding sorry at all. "But they were
<br>our kind, weren't they?"
<br>
<br>"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean."
<br>
<br>"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're
<br>just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some
<br>of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter,
<br>imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families.
<br>What's your surname, anyway?"
<br>
<br>But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, "That's you done, my
<br>dear," and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy,
<br>hopped down from the footstool.
<br>
<br>"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose," said the drawling boy.
<br>
<br>Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him
<br>(chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).
<br>
<br>"What's up?" said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>"Nothing," Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry
<br>cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you
<br>wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, "Hagrid, what's Quidditch?"
<br>
<br>"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know -- not knowin'
<br>about Quidditch!"
<br>
<br>"Don't make me feel worse," said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate
<br>boy in Madam Malkin's.
<br>
<br>"--and he said people from Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed
<br>in."
<br>
<br>"Yer not from a Muggle family. If he'd known who yeh were -- he's grown
<br>up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk. You saw what
<br>everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what
<br>does he know about it, some o' the best I ever saw were the only ones
<br>with magic in 'em in a long line 0' Muggles -- look at yer mum! Look
<br>what she had fer a sister!"
<br>
<br>"So what is Quidditch?"
<br>
<br>"It's our sport. Wizard sport. It's like -- like soccer in the Muggle
<br>world -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on
<br>broomsticks and there's four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules."
<br>"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?"
<br>
<br>"School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o'
<br>duffers, but --"
<br>
<br>"I bet I'm in Hufflepuff" said Harry gloomily.
<br>
<br>"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin," said Hagrid darkly. "There's not a
<br>single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.
<br>You-Know-Who was one."
<br>
<br>"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?"
<br>
<br>"Years an' years ago," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>They bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts
<br>where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as
<br>paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in
<br>covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with
<br>nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have
<br>been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid <b>almost</b>  had to drag
<br>Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and
<br>Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs,
<br>Tongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
<br>
<br>"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley."
<br>
<br>"I'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the
<br>Muggle world except in very special circumstances," said Hagrid. "An'
<br>anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more
<br>study before yeh get ter that level."
<br>
<br>Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either ("It says
<br>pewter on yer list"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing
<br>potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited
<br>the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible
<br>smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff
<br>stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined
<br>the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung
<br>from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a
<br>supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself
<br>examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule,
<br>glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).
<br>
<br>Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again.
<br>
<br>"Just yer wand left - A yeah, an' I still haven't got yeh a birthday
<br>present."
<br>
<br>Harry felt himself go red.
<br>
<br>"You don't have to --"
<br>
<br>"I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not a toad,
<br>toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don'
<br>like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All the kids want
<br>owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'."
<br>
<br>Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been
<br>dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now
<br>carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with
<br>her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks,
<br>sounding just like Professor Quirrell.
<br>
<br>"Don' mention it," said Hagrid gruffly. "Don' expect you've had a lotta
<br>presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer
<br>wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand."
<br>
<br>A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.
<br>
<br>The last shop was narrow and <b>shabby</b> . Peeling gold letters over the door
<br>read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay
<br>on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.
<br>
<br>A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped
<br>inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair
<br>that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had
<br>entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that
<br>had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow
<br>boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of
<br>his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle
<br>with some secret magic.
<br>
<br>"Good afternoon," said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have
<br>jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly
<br>off the spindly chair.
<br>
<br>An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like
<br>moons through the gloom of the shop.
<br>
<br>"Hello," said Harry awkwardly.
<br>
<br>"Ah yes," said the man. "Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon.
<br>Harry Potter." It wasn't a question. "You have your mother's eyes. It
<br>seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten
<br>and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm
<br>work."
<br>
<br>Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those
<br>silvery eyes were a bit creepy.
<br>
<br>"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches.
<br>Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I
<br>say your father favored it -- it's really the wand that chooses the
<br>wizard, of course."
<br>
<br>Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were <b>almost</b>  nose to
<br>nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.
<br>
<br>"And that's where..."
<br>
<br>Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a
<br>long, white finger.
<br>
<br>"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it," he said softly.
<br>"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in
<br>the wrong hands... well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into
<br>the world to do...."
<br>
<br>He shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid.
<br>
<br>"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen
<br>inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?"
<br>
<br>"It was, sir, yes," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got
<br>expelled?" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.
<br>
<br>"Er -- yes, they did, yes," said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. "I've still
<br>got the pieces, though," he added brightly.
<br>
<br>"But you don't use them?" said Mr. Ollivander sharply.
<br>
<br>"Oh, no, sit," said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink
<br>umbrella very tightly as he spoke.
<br>
<br>"Hmmm," said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. "Well, now
<br>-- Mr. Potter. Let me see." He pulled a long tape measure with silver
<br>markings out of his pocket. "Which is your wand arm?"
<br>
<br>"Er -- well, I'm right-handed," said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Hold out your arm. That's it." He measured Harry from shoulder to
<br>finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round
<br>his head. As he measured, he said, "Every Ollivander wand has a core of
<br>a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix
<br>tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands
<br>are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite
<br>the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with
<br>another wizard's wand."
<br>
<br>Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring
<br>between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was
<br>flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.
<br>
<br>"That will do," he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on
<br>the floor. "Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon
<br>heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a
<br>wave."
<br>
<br>Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr.
<br>Ollivander snatched it out of his hand <b>almost</b>  at once.
<br>
<br>"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try --"
<br>
<br>Harry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was
<br>snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.
<br>
<br>"No, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.
<br>Go on, go on, try it out."
<br>
<br>Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting
<br>for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the
<br>spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the
<br>shelves, the happier he seemed to become.
<br>
<br>"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here
<br>somewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination --
<br>holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple."
<br>
<br>Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised
<br>the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air
<br>and a stream of red and gold sparks <b>shot</b>  from the end like a firework,
<br>throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and
<br>clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, "Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very
<br>good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... "
<br>
<br>He put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper,
<br>still muttering, "Curious... curious..
<br>
<br>"Sorry," said Harry, "but what's curious?"
<br>
<br>Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.
<br>
<br>"I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It
<br>so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave
<br>another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you
<br>should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave
<br>you that scar."
<br>
<br>Harry swallowed.
<br>
<br>"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things
<br>happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we must expect
<br>great things from you, Mr. Potter.... After all, He-
<br>Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great."
<br>
<br>Harry shivered. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid
<br>seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his
<br>shop.
<br>
<br>The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made
<br>their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through
<br>the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn't speak at all as they walked
<br>down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at
<br>them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped
<br>packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry's lap. Up
<br>another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized
<br>where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.
<br>
<br>"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves," he said.
<br>
<br>He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat
<br>them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.
<br>
<br>"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>Harry wasn't sure he could explain. He'd just had the best birthday of
<br>his life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the
<br>words.
<br>
<br>"Everyone thinks I'm special," he said at last. "All those people in the
<br>Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don't know
<br>anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I'm
<br>famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for. I don't know what
<br>happened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died."
<br>
<br>Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he
<br>wore a very kind smile.
<br>
<br>"Don' you worry, Harry. You'll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the
<br>beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. just be yerself. I know it's
<br>hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have a
<br>great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, 'smatter of fact."
<br>
<br>Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the
<br>Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.
<br>
<br>"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, " he said. "First o' September -- King's Cross
<br>-- it's all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a
<br>letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... See yeh soon,
<br>Harry."
<br>
<br>The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until
<br>he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against
<br>the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER SIX
<br>
<br>THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS
<br>
<br>Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so
<br>scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia
<br>and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do
<br>anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn't speak to him at all.
<br>Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry
<br>in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did
<br>become a bit depressing after a while.
<br>
<br>Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to
<br>call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school
<br>books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the
<br>night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It
<br>was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because
<br>Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to
<br>sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned
<br>to the wall, counting down to September the first.
<br>
<br>On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and
<br>uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went
<br>down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on
<br>television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and
<br>Dudley screamed and ran from the room.
<br>
<br>"Er -- Uncle Vernon?"
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.
<br>
<br>"Er -- I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts."
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon grunted again.
<br>
<br>"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?"
<br>
<br>Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.
<br>
<br>"Thank you."
<br>
<br>He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.
<br>
<br>"Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train. Magic carpets all got
<br>punctures, have they?"
<br>
<br>Harry didn't say anything.
<br>
<br>"Where is this school, anyway?"
<br>
<br>"I don't know," said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled
<br>the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.
<br>
<br>"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven
<br>o'clock," he read.
<br>
<br>His aunt and uncle stared.
<br>
<br>"Platform what?"
<br>
<br>"Nine and three-quarters."
<br>
<br>"Don't talk rubbish," said Uncle Vernon. "There is no platform nine and
<br>three-quarters."
<br>
<br>"It's on my ticket."
<br>
<br>"Barking," said Uncle Vernon, "howling mad, the lot of them. You'll see.
<br>You just wait. All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going up
<br>to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother."
<br>
<br>"Why are you going to London?" Harry asked, trying to keep things
<br>friendly.
<br>
<br>"Taking Dudley to the hospital," growled Uncle Vernon. "Got to have that
<br>ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings."
<br>
<br>Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and
<br>nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because
<br>he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes -- he'd
<br>change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure
<br>he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her
<br>cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two
<br>hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the
<br>Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to
<br>Harry, and they had set off.
<br>
<br>They reached King's Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's
<br>trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought
<br>this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the
<br>platforms with a nasty grin on his face.
<br>
<br>"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform
<br>should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it
<br>yet, do they?"
<br>
<br>He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic <b>number</b>  nine over
<br>one platform and a big plastic <b>number</b>  ten over the one next to it, and
<br>in the middle, nothing at all.
<br>
<br>"Have a good term," said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He
<br>left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away.
<br>All three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on
<br>earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny
<br>looks, because of Hedwig. He'd have to ask someone.
<br>
<br>He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and
<br>three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry
<br>couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to
<br>get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting
<br>desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o'clock, but
<br>the guard said there wasn't one. In the end the guard strode away,
<br>muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic.
<br>According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes
<br>left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he
<br>was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly
<br>lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.
<br>
<br>Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like
<br>tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He
<br>wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket
<br>inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten.
<br>
<br>At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a
<br>few words of what they were saying.
<br>
<br>"-- packed with Muggles, of course --"
<br>
<br>Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four
<br>boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like
<br>Harry's in front of him -- and they had an owl.
<br>
<br>Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so
<br>did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.
<br>
<br>"Now, what's the platform <b>number</b> ?" said the boys' mother.
<br>
<br>"Nine and three-quarters!" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was
<br>holding her hand, "Mom, can't I go... "
<br>
<br>"You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go
<br>first."
<br>
<br>What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.
<br>Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as
<br>the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large
<br>crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last
<br>backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.
<br>
<br>"Fred, you next," the plump woman said.
<br>
<br>"I'm not Fred, I'm George," said the boy. "Honestly, woman, you call
<br>yourself our mother? CarA you tell I'm George?"
<br>
<br>"Sorry, George, dear."
<br>
<br>"Only joking, I am Fred," said the boy, and off he went. His twin called
<br>after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later,
<br>he had gone -- but how had he done it?
<br>
<br>Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was
<br><b>almost</b>  there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere.
<br>
<br>There was nothing else for it.
<br>
<br>"Excuse me," Harry said to the plump woman.
<br>
<br>"Hello, dear," she said. "First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too."
<br>
<br>She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and
<br>gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.
<br>
<br>"Yes," said Harry. "The thing is -- the thing is, I don't know how to
<br>--"
<br>
<br>"How to get onto the platform?" she said kindly, and Harry nodded.
<br>
<br>"Not to worry," she said. "All you have to do is walk straight at the
<br>barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared
<br>you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a
<br>run if you're nervous. Go on, go now before Ron."
<br>
<br>"Er -- okay," said Harry.
<br>
<br>He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very
<br>solid.
<br>
<br>He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to
<br>platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash
<br>right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward
<br>on his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer
<br>and nearer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- the cart was out of control
<br>-- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash --
<br>
<br>It didn't come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet
<br>steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign
<br>overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O'clock. Harry looked behind him
<br>and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the
<br>words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.
<br>
<br>Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the <b>chattering</b>  crowd,
<br>while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls
<br>hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and
<br>the scraping of heavy trunks.
<br>
<br>The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging
<br>out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats.
<br>Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat.
<br>He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, "Gran, I've lost my toad
<br>again."
<br>
<br>"Oh, Neville," he heard the old woman sigh.
<br>
<br>A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.
<br>
<br>"Give us a look, Lee, go on."
<br>
<br>The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him
<br>shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.
<br>
<br>Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment
<br>near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started
<br>to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it
<br>up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it
<br>painfully on his foot.
<br>
<br>"Want a hand?" It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through
<br>the barrier.
<br>
<br>"Yes, please," Harry panted.
<br>
<br>"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!"
<br>
<br>With the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner
<br>of the compartment.
<br>
<br>"Thanks," said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.
<br>
<br>"What's that?" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's
<br>lightning scar.
<br>
<br>"Blimey," said the other twin. "Are you
<br>
<br>"He is," said the first twin. "Aren't you?" he added to Harry.
<br>
<br>"What?" said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Harry Potter, "chorused the twins.
<br>
<br>"Oh, him," said Harry. "I mean, yes, I am."
<br>
<br>The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to
<br>his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door.
<br>
<br>"Fred? George? Are you there?"
<br>
<br>"Coming, Mom."
<br>
<br>With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.
<br>
<br>Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the
<br>red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their
<br>mother had just taken out her <b>handkerchief</b> .
<br>
<br>"Ron, you've got something on your nose."
<br>
<br>The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and
<br>began rubbing the end of his nose.
<br>
<br>"Mom -- geroff" He wriggled free.
<br>
<br>"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?" said one of the
<br>twins.
<br>
<br>"Shut up," said Ron.
<br>
<br>"Where's Percy?" said their mother.
<br>
<br>"He's coming now."
<br>
<br>The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his
<br>billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge
<br>on his chest with the letter P on it.
<br>
<br>"Can't stay long, Mother," he said. "I'm up front, the prefects have got
<br>two compartments to themselves --"
<br>
<br>"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?" said one of the twins, with an air of
<br>great surprise. "You should have said something, we had no idea."
<br>
<br>"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it," said the
<br>other twin. "Once --"
<br>
<br>"Or twice --"
<br>
<br>"A minute --"
<br>
<br>"All summer --"
<br>
<br>"Oh, shut up," said Percy the Prefect.
<br>
<br>"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?" said one of the twins.
<br>
<br>"Because he's a prefect," said their mother fondly. "All right, dear,
<br>well, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there."
<br>
<br>She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.
<br>
<br>"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl
<br>telling me you've -- you've blown up a toilet or --"
<br>
<br>"Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet."
<br>
<br>"Great idea though, thanks, Mom."
<br>
<br>"It's not funny. And look after Ron."
<br>
<br>"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us."
<br>
<br>"Shut up," said Ron again. He was <b>almost</b>  as tall as the twins already
<br>and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.
<br>
<br>"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?"
<br>
<br>Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking.
<br>
<br>"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who
<br>he is?"
<br>
<br>"Who?"
<br>
<br>"Harry Potter!"
<br>
<br>Harry heard the little girl's voice.
<br>
<br>"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please...."
<br>
<br>"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the <b>poor</b>  boy <b>isn</b> 't something you
<br>goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?"
<br>
<br>"Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really there - like lightning."
<br>
<br>"Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite
<br>when he asked how to get onto the platform."
<br>
<br>"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks
<br>like?"
<br>
<br>Their mother suddenly became very stern.
<br>
<br>"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though he needs
<br>reminding of that on his first day at school."
<br>
<br>"All right, keep your hair on."
<br>
<br>A whistle sounded.
<br>
<br>"Hurry up!" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the
<br>train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and
<br>their younger sister began to cry.
<br>
<br>"Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls."
<br>
<br>"We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat."
<br>
<br>"George!"
<br>
<br>"Only joking, Mom."
<br>
<br>The train began to move. Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their
<br>sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train
<br>until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.
<br>
<br>Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the
<br>corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of
<br>excitement. He didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better
<br>than what he was leaving behind.
<br>
<br>The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy
<br>came in.
<br>
<br>"Anyone sitting there?" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry.
<br>"Everywhere else is full."
<br>
<br>Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then
<br>looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked. Harry saw
<br>he still had a black mark on his nose.
<br>
<br>"Hey, Ron."
<br>
<br>The twins were back.
<br>
<br>"Listen, we're going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan's got a
<br>giant tarantula down there."
<br>
<br>"Right," mumbled Ron.
<br>
<br>"Harry," said the other twin, "did we introduce ourselves? Fred and
<br>George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.
<br>
<br>"Bye," said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut
<br>behind them.
<br>
<br>"Are you really Harry Potter?" Ron blurted out.
<br>
<br>Harry nodded.
<br>
<br>"Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes," said
<br>Ron. "And have you really got -- you know..."
<br>
<br>He pointed at Harry's forehead.
<br>
<br>Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.
<br>
<br>"So that's where You-Know-Who
<br>
<br>"Yes," said Harry, "but I can't remember it."
<br>
<br>"Nothing?" said Ron eagerly.
<br>
<br>"Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else."
<br>
<br>"Wow," said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as
<br>though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out
<br>of the window again.
<br>
<br>"Are all your family wizards?" asked Harry, who found Ron just as
<br>interesting as Ron found him.
<br>
<br>"Er -- Yes, I think so," said Ron. "I think Mom's got a second cousin
<br>who's an accountant, but we never talk about him."
<br>
<br>"So you must know loads of magic already."
<br>
<br>The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale
<br>boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.
<br>
<br>"I heard you went to live with Muggles," said Ron. "What are they like?"
<br>
<br>"Horrible -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,
<br>though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers."
<br>
<br>"Five," said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. "I'm the sixth
<br>in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up
<br>to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie
<br>was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess
<br>around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks
<br>they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others,
<br>but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get
<br>anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes,
<br>Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat."
<br>
<br>Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was
<br>asleep.
<br>
<br>"His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy
<br>got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff
<br>-- I mean, I got Scabbers instead."
<br>
<br>Ron's ears went pink. He seemed to think he'd said too much, because he
<br>went back to staring out of the window.
<br>
<br>Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to
<br>afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a
<br>month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old
<br>clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer
<br>Ron up.
<br>
<br>"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about be ing a
<br>wizard or about my parents or Voldemort"
<br>
<br>Ron gasped.
<br>
<br>"What?" said Harry.
<br>
<br>"You said You-Know-Who's name!" said Ron, sounding both shocked and
<br>impressed. "I'd have thought you, of all people --"
<br>
<br>"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name," said Harry, I
<br>just never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads to
<br>learn.... I bet," he added, voicing for the first time something that
<br>had been worrying him a lot lately, "I bet I'm the worst in the class."
<br>
<br>"You won't be. There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and
<br>they learn quick enough."
<br>
<br>While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.
<br>Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were
<br>quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.
<br>
<br>Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the
<br>corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said,
<br>"Anything off the cart, dears?"
<br>
<br>Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears
<br>went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went
<br>out into the corridor.
<br>
<br>He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he
<br>had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many
<br>Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have Mars Bars. What
<br>she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best
<br>Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice
<br>Wands, and a <b>number</b>  of other strange things Harry had never seen in his
<br>life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid
<br>the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.
<br>
<br>Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped
<br>it onto an empty seat.
<br>
<br>"Hungry, are you?"
<br>
<br>"Starving," said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.
<br>
<br>Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four
<br>sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, "She always
<br>forgets I don't like corned beef."
<br>
<br>"Swap you for one of these," said Harry, holding up a pasty. "Go on --"
<br>
<br>"You don't want this, it's all dry," said Ron. "She hasn't got much
<br>time," he added quickly, "you know, with five of us."
<br>
<br>"Go on, have a pasty," said Harry, who had never had anything to share
<br>before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling,
<br>sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties,
<br>cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).
<br>
<br>"What are these?" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs.
<br>"They're not really frogs, are they?" He was starting to feel that
<br>nothing would surprise him.
<br>
<br>"No," said Ron. "But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa."
<br>
<br>"What?"
<br>
<br>"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside
<br>them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I've got about
<br>five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy."
<br>
<br>Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a
<br>man's face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and
<br>flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the
<br>name Albus Dumbledore.
<br>
<br>"So this is Dumbledore!" said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!" said Ron. "Can I have a
<br>frog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks
<br>
<br>Harry turned over his card and read:
<br>
<br>ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
<br>
<br>CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS
<br>
<br>Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is
<br>particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in
<br>1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his
<br>work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore
<br>enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.
<br>
<br>Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that
<br>Dumbledore's face had disappeared.
<br>
<br>"He's gone!"
<br>
<br>"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day," said Ron. "He'll be
<br>back. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her... do you
<br>want it? You can start collecting."
<br>
<br>Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be
<br>unwrapped.
<br>
<br>"Help yourself," said Harry. "But in, you know, the Muggle world, people
<br>just stay put in photos."
<br>
<br>"Do they? What, they don't move at all?" Ron sounded amazed. "weird!"
<br>
<br>Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and
<br>gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than
<br>looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep
<br>his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but
<br>Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin.
<br>He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was
<br>scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.
<br>
<br>"You want to be careful with those," Ron warned Harry. "When they say
<br>every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the
<br>ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then
<br>you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-
<br>flavored one once."
<br>
<br>Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a
<br>corner.
<br>
<br>"Bleaaargh -- see? Sprouts."
<br>
<br>They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast,
<br>coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was
<br>even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't
<br>touch, which turned out to be pepper.
<br>
<br>The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat
<br>fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green
<br>hills.
<br>
<br>There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced
<br>boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He
<br>looked tearful.
<br>
<br>"Sorry," he said, "but have you seen a toad at all?"
<br>
<br>When they shook their heads, he wailed, "I've lost him! He keeps getting
<br>away from me!"
<br>
<br>"He'll turn up," said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Yes," said the boy miserably. "Well, if you see him..."
<br>
<br>He left.
<br>
<br>"Don't know why he's so bothered," said Ron. "If I'd brought a toad I'd
<br>lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't
<br>talk."
<br>
<br>The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap.
<br>
<br>"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference," said Ron in
<br>disgust. "I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more
<br>interesting, but the <b>spell</b>  didn't work. I'll show you, look..."
<br>
<br>He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking
<br>wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the
<br>end.
<br>
<br>"Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway
<br>
<br>He had just raised his 'wand when the compartment door slid open again.
<br>The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was
<br>already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.
<br>
<br>"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one," she said. She had a bossy
<br>sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.
<br>
<br>"We've already told him we haven't seen it," said Ron, but the girl
<br>wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.
<br>
<br>"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then."
<br>
<br>She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.
<br>
<br>"Er -- all right."
<br>
<br>He cleared his throat.
<br>
<br>"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow."
<br>
<br>He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast
<br>asleep.
<br>
<br>"Are you sure that's a real <b>spell</b> ?" said the girl. "Well, it's not very
<br>good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's
<br>all worked for me. Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such
<br>a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I
<br>mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard --
<br>I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it
<br>will be enough -- I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you.
<br>
<br>She said all this very fast.
<br>
<br>Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he
<br>hadn't learned all the course books by heart either.
<br>
<br>"I'm Ron Weasley," Ron muttered.
<br>
<br>"Harry Potter," said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Are you really?" said Hermione. "I know all about you, of course -- I
<br>got a few extra books. for background reading, and you're in Modern
<br>Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the <b>Dark</b>  Arts and Great
<br>Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.
<br>
<br>"Am I?" said Harry, feeling dazed.
<br>
<br>"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it
<br>was me," said Hermione. "Do either of you know what house you'll be in?
<br>I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far
<br>the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw
<br>wouldn't be too bad.... Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's
<br>toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there
<br>soon."
<br>
<br>And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.
<br>
<br>"Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it," said Ron. He threw his
<br>wand back into his trunk. "Stupid <b>spell</b>  -- George gave it to me, bet he
<br>knew it was a dud."
<br>
<br>"What house are your brothers in?" asked Harry.
<br>
<br>"Gryffindor," said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. "Mom
<br>and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I
<br>don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in
<br>Slytherin."
<br>
<br>"That's the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?"
<br>
<br>"Yeah," said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.
<br>
<br>"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,"
<br>said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off houses. "So what do your
<br>oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?"
<br>
<br>Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school.
<br>
<br>"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing
<br>something for Gringotts," said Ron. "Did you hear about
<br>
<br>Gringotts? It's been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you
<br>get that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security
<br>vault."
<br>
<br>Harry stared.
<br>
<br>"Really? What happened to them?"
<br>
<br>"Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught. My
<br>dad says it must've been a powerful <b>Dark</b>  wizard to get round Gringotts,
<br>but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd. 'Course,
<br>everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case
<br>You-Know-Who's behind it."
<br>
<br>Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a
<br>prickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this
<br>was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more
<br>comfortable saying "Voldemort" without worrying.
<br>
<br>"What's your Quidditch team?" Ron asked.
<br>
<br>"Er -- I don't know any," Harry confessed.
<br>
<br>"What!" Ron looked dumbfounded. "Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the
<br>world --" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the
<br>positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to
<br>with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the
<br>money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game
<br>when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the
<br>toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.
<br>
<br>Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was
<br>the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry with
<br>a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley.
<br>
<br>"Is it true?" he said. "They're saying all down the train that Harry
<br>Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?"
<br>
<br>"Yes," said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were
<br>thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale
<br>boy, they looked like bodyguards.
<br>
<br>"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle," said the pale boy carelessly,
<br>noticing where Harry was looking. "And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy."
<br>
<br>Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco
<br>Malfoy looked at him.
<br>
<br>"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father
<br>told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than
<br>they can afford."
<br>
<br>He turned back to Harry. "You'll soon find out some wizarding families
<br>are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends
<br>with the wrong sort. I can help you there."
<br>
<br>He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.
<br>
<br>"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks," he said
<br>coolly.
<br>
<br>Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale
<br>cheeks.
<br>
<br>"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter," he said slowly. "Unless you're a
<br>bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know
<br>what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the
<br>Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you."
<br>
<br>Both Harry and Ron stood up.
<br>
<br>"Say that again," Ron said, his face as red as his hair.
<br>
<br>"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?" Malfoy sneered.
<br>
<br>"Unless you get out now," said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because
<br>Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.
<br>
<br>"But we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food
<br>and you still seem to have some."
<br>
<br>Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt
<br>forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a
<br>horrible yell.
<br>
<br>Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk
<br>deep into Goyle's knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung
<br>Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbets finally flew off
<br>and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they
<br>thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd
<br>heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.
<br>
<br>"What has been going on?" she said, looking at the sweets all over the
<br>floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.
<br>
<br>I think he's been knocked out," Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at
<br>Scabbers. "No -- I don't believe it -- he's gone back to sleep-"
<br>
<br>And so he had.
<br>
<br>"You've met Malfoy before?"
<br>
<br>Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.
<br>
<br>"I've heard of his family," said Ron darkly. "They were some of the
<br>first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said
<br>they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's
<br>father didn't need an excuse to go over to the <b>Dark</b>  Side." He turned to
<br>Hermione. "Can we help you with something?"
<br>
<br>"You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the
<br>front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there. You haven't
<br>been fighting, have you? You'll be in trouble before we even get there!"
<br>
<br>"Scabbers has been fighting, not us," said Ron, scowling at her. "Would
<br>you mind leaving while we change?"
<br>
<br>"All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving
<br>very childishly, racing up and down the corridors," said Hermione in a
<br>sniffy voice. "And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you
<br>know?"
<br>
<br>Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was
<br>getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple
<br>sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.
<br>
<br>He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.
<br>Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath
<br>them.
<br>
<br>A voice echoed through the train: "We will be reaching Hogwarts in five
<br>minutes' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken
<br>to the school separately."
<br>
<br>Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under
<br>his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and
<br>joined the crowd thronging the corridor.
<br>
<br>The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way
<br>toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in
<br>the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the
<br>students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: "Firs' years! Firs' years
<br>over here! All right there, Harry?"
<br>
<br>Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.
<br>
<br>"C'mon, follow me -- any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs'
<br>years follow me!"
<br>
<br>Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a
<br>steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry
<br>thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the
<br>boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.
<br>
<br>"Ye' all get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec," Hagrid called over
<br>his shoulder, "jus' round this bend here."
<br>
<br>There was a loud "Oooooh!"
<br>
<br>The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take.
<br>Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in
<br>the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.
<br>
<br>"No more'n four to a boat!" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little
<br>boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed
<br>into their boat by Neville and Hermione. "Everyone in?" shouted Hagrid,
<br>who had a boat to himself. "Right then -- FORWARD!"
<br>
<br>And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the
<br>lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at
<br>the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer
<br>and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.
<br>
<br>"Heads down!" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they
<br>all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain
<br>of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried
<br>along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the
<br>castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they
<br>clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.
<br>
<br>"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?" said Hagrid, who was checking the
<br>boats as people climbed out of them.
<br>
<br>"Trevor!" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they
<br>clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at
<br>last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.
<br>
<br>They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak
<br>front door.
<br>
<br>"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?"
<br>
<br>Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle
<br>door.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER SEVEN
<br>
<br>THE SORTING HAT
<br>
<br>The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green
<br>robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought
<br>was that this was not someone to cross.
<br>
<br>"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here."
<br>
<br>She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have
<br>fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit
<br>with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too
<br>high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to
<br>the upper floors.
<br>
<br>They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry
<br>could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right
<br>-the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall
<br>showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They
<br>crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have
<br>done, peering about nervously.
<br>
<br>"Welcome to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. "The start-of-term
<br>banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great
<br>Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very
<br>important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be
<br>something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with
<br>the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free
<br>time in your house common room.
<br>
<br>"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
<br>Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced
<br>outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your
<br>triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose
<br>house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is
<br>awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a
<br>credit to whichever house becomes yours.
<br>
<br>"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the
<br>rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as
<br>you can while you are waiting."
<br>
<br>Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened
<br>under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to
<br>flatten his hair.
<br>
<br>"I shall return when we are ready for you," said Professor McGonagall.
<br>"Please wait quietly."
<br>
<br>She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.
<br>
<br>"How exactly do they sort us into houses?" he asked Ron.
<br>
<br>"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he
<br>was joking."
<br>
<br>Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole
<br>school? But he didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have
<br>to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived.
<br>He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified,
<br>too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering
<br>very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one
<br>she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more
<br>nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to
<br>the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He
<br>kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall
<br>would come back and lead him to his doom.
<br>
<br>Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air --
<br>several people behind him screamed.
<br>
<br>"What the --?"
<br>
<br>He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just
<br>streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent,
<br>they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing
<br>at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat
<br>little monk was saying: "Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him
<br>a second chance --"
<br>
<br>"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He
<br>gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost -- I
<br>say, what are you all doing here?"
<br>
<br>A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.
<br>
<br>Nobody answered.
<br>
<br>"New students!" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. "About to be
<br>Sorted, I suppose?"
<br>
<br>A few people nodded mutely.
<br>
<br>"<b>Hope</b>  to see you in Hufflepuff!" said the Friar. "My old house, you
<br>know."
<br>
<br>"Move along now," said a sharp voice. "The Sorting Ceremony's about to
<br>start."
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away
<br>through the opposite wall.
<br>
<br>"Now, form a line," Professor McGonagall told the first years, "and
<br>follow me."
<br>
<br>Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line
<br>behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out
<br>of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors
<br>into the Great Hall.
<br>
<br>Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was
<br>lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair
<br>over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.
<br>These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the
<br>top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.
<br>Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a
<br>halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.
<br>The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the
<br>flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the
<br>ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry
<br>looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He
<br>heard
<br>
<br>Hermione <b>whisper</b> , "Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read
<br>about it in Hogwarts, A History."
<br>
<br>It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the
<br>Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.
<br>
<br>Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed
<br>a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she
<br>put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was <b>patched</b>  and frayed and
<br>extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house.
<br>
<br>Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly,
<br>that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was
<br>now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there
<br>was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened
<br>wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:
<br>
<br>"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,
<br>
<br>But don't judge on what you see,
<br>
<br>I'll eat myself if you can find
<br>
<br>A smarter hat than me.
<br>
<br>You can keep your bowlers black,
<br>
<br>Your top hats sleek and tall,
<br>
<br>For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
<br>
<br>And I can cap them all.
<br>
<br>There's nothing hidden in your head
<br>
<br>The Sorting Hat can't see,
<br>
<br>So try me on and I will tell you
<br>
<br>Where you ought to be.
<br>
<br>You might belong in Gryffindor,
<br>
<br>Where dwell the brave at heart,
<br>
<br>Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart;
<br>
<br>You might belong in Hufflepuff,
<br>
<br>Where they are just and loyal,
<br>
<br>Those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil;
<br>
<br>Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
<br>
<br>if you've a ready mind,
<br>
<br>Where those of wit and learning,
<br>
<br>Will always find their kind;
<br>
<br>Or perhaps in Slytherin
<br>
<br>You'll make your real friends,
<br>
<br>Those cunning folk use any means
<br>
<br>To achieve their ends.
<br>
<br>So put me on! Don't be afraid!
<br>
<br>And don't get in a flap!
<br>
<br>You're in safe hands (though I have none)
<br>
<br>For I'm a Thinking Cap!"
<br>
<br>The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It
<br>bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.
<br>
<br>"So we've just got to try on the hat!" Ron whispered to Harry. "I'll
<br>kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll."
<br>
<br>Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than
<br>having to do a <b>spell</b> , but he did wish they could have tried it on
<br>without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather alot;
<br>Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If
<br>only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy,
<br>that would have been the one for him.
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of
<br>parchment.
<br>
<br>"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to
<br>be sorted," she said. "Abbott, Hannah!"
<br>
<br>A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the
<br>hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause
<br>--
<br>
<br>"HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat.
<br>
<br>The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at
<br>the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving
<br>merrily at her.
<br>
<br>"Bones, Susan!"
<br>
<br>"HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next
<br>to Hannah.
<br>
<br>"Boot, Terry!"
<br>
<br>"RAVENCLAW!"
<br>
<br>The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws
<br>stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.
<br>
<br>" Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender"
<br>became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded
<br>with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.
<br>
<br>"Bulstrode, Millicent" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's
<br>imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they
<br>looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick
<br>now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school.
<br>He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but
<br>because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.
<br>
<br>"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!"
<br>
<br>"HUFFLEPUFF!"
<br>
<br>Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at
<br>others it took a little while to decide. "Finnigan, Seamus," the
<br>sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for <b>almost</b> 
<br>a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.
<br>
<br>"Granger, Hermione!"
<br>
<br>Hermione <b>almost</b>  ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.
<br>
<br>"GRYFFINDOR!" shouted the hat. Ron groaned.
<br>
<br>A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when
<br>you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just
<br>sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor
<br>McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a
<br>mistake and he'd better get back on the train?
<br>
<br>When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called,
<br>he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide
<br>with Neville. When it finally shouted, "GRYFFINDOR," Neville ran off
<br>still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it
<br>to "MacDougal, Morag."
<br>
<br>Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at
<br>once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, "SLYTHERIN!"
<br>
<br>Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with
<br>himself.
<br>
<br>There weren't many people left now. "Moon" "Nott" "Parkinson" then a
<br>pair of twin girls, "Patil" and "Patil" then "Perks, Sally-Anne" and
<br>then, at last -- "Potter, Harry!"
<br>
<br>As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little
<br>hissing fires all over the hall.
<br>
<br>"Potter, did she say?"
<br>
<br>The Harry Potter?"
<br>
<br>The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the
<br>hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he
<br>was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.
<br>
<br>Hmm," said a small voice in his ear. "Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty
<br>of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, A my goodness,
<br>yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting....
<br>So where shall I put you?"
<br>
<br>Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not
<br>Slytherin.
<br>
<br>"Not Slytherin, eh?" said the small voice. "Are you sure? You could be
<br>great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you
<br>on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you're sure
<br>-- better be GRYFFINDOR!"
<br>
<br>Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off
<br>the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so
<br>relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed
<br>that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and
<br>shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, "We got
<br>Potter! We got Potter!" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff
<br>he'd seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden,
<br>horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.
<br>
<br>He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat
<br>Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned
<br>back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair,
<br>sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd
<br>gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair
<br>was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the
<br>ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man
<br>from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple
<br>turban.
<br>
<br>And now there were only three people left to be sorted. "Thomas, Dean,"
<br>a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table.
<br>"Turpin, Lisa," became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn. He was
<br>pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a
<br>second later the hat had shouted, "GRYFFINDOR!"
<br>
<br>Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next
<br>to him.
<br>
<br>"Well done, Ron, excellent," said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry
<br>as "Zabini, Blaise," was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled
<br>up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.
<br>
<br>Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how
<br>hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.
<br>
<br>Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students,
<br>his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to
<br>see them all there.
<br>
<br>"Welcome," he said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin
<br>our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit!
<br>Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!
<br>
<br>"Thank you!"
<br>
<br>He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know
<br>whether to laugh or not.
<br>
<br>"Is he -- a bit mad?" he asked Percy uncertainly.
<br>
<br>"Mad?" said Percy airily. "He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But
<br>he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?"
<br>
<br>Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with
<br>food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table:
<br>roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon
<br>and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding,
<br>peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint
<br>humbugs.
<br>
<br>The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been
<br>allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything
<br>that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his
<br>plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat.
<br>It was all delicious.
<br>
<br>"That does look good," said the ghost in the ruff <b>sadly</b> , watching Harry
<br>cut up his steak,
<br>
<br>"Can't you --?"
<br>
<br>I haven't eaten for nearly four hundred years," said the ghost. "I don't
<br>need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've in troduced
<br>myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost
<br>of Gryffindor Tower."
<br>
<br>"I know who you are!" said Ron suddenly. "My brothers told me about you
<br>-- you're Nearly Headless Nick!"
<br>
<br>"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy --" the ghost began
<br>stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
<br>
<br>"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?"
<br>
<br>Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't
<br>going at all the way he wanted.
<br>
<br>"Like this," he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His
<br>whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on
<br>a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it
<br>properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly
<br>Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said,
<br>"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house
<br>championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without
<br>winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody
<br>Baron's becoming <b>almost</b>  unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost."
<br>
<br>Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost
<br>sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained
<br>with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to
<br>see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.
<br>
<br>"How did he get covered in blood?" asked Seamus with great interest.
<br>
<br>"I've never asked," said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.
<br>
<br>When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food
<br>faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment
<br>later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you
<br>could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam
<br>doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- "
<br>
<br>As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their
<br>families.
<br>
<br>"I'm half-and-half," said Seamus. "Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell
<br>him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock
<br>for him."
<br>
<br>The others laughed.
<br>
<br>"What about you, Neville?" said Ron.
<br>
<br>"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch," said Neville, "but the
<br>family thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept
<br>trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he
<br>pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but
<br>nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for
<br>dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles
<br>when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let
<br>go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They
<br>were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you
<br>should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might
<br>not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased
<br>he bought me my toad."
<br>
<br>On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about
<br>lessons ("I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm
<br>particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something
<br>into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-";
<br>"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of
<br>thing -- ").
<br>
<br>Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at
<br>
<br>the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.
<br>Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor
<br>Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy
<br>black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.
<br>
<br>It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's
<br>turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain <b>shot</b>  across
<br>the scar on Harry's forehead.
<br>
<br>"Ouch!" Harry clapped a hand to his head.
<br>
<br>"What is it?" asked Percy.
<br>
<br>"N-nothing."
<br>
<br>The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the
<br>feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he
<br>didn't like Harry at all.
<br>
<br>"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?" he asked Percy.
<br>
<br>"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so
<br>nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want
<br>to -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about
<br>the <b>Dark</b>  Arts, Snape."
<br>
<br>Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.
<br>
<br>At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to
<br>his feet again. The hall fell silent.
<br>
<br>"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I
<br>have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
<br>
<br>"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to
<br>all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember
<br>that as well."
<br>
<br>Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley
<br>twins.
<br>
<br>"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all
<br>that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.
<br>
<br>"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone
<br>interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.
<br>
<br>"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor
<br>on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to
<br>die a very painful death."
<br>
<br>Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.
<br>
<br>"He's not serious?" he muttered to Percy.
<br>
<br>"Must be," said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. "It's odd, because he
<br>usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere -- the
<br>forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he
<br>might have told us prefects, at least."
<br>
<br>"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried
<br>Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become
<br>rather fixed.
<br>
<br>Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a
<br>fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose
<br>high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.
<br>
<br>"Everyone pick their favorite tune," said Dumbledore, "and off we go!"
<br>And the school bellowed:
<br>
<br>"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,
<br>
<br>Teach us something please,
<br>
<br>Whether we be old and bald
<br>
<br>Or young with scabby knees,
<br>
<br>Our heads could do with filling
<br>
<br>With some interesting stuff,
<br>
<br>For now they're bare and full of air,
<br>
<br>Dead flies and bits of fluff,
<br>
<br>So teach us things worth knowing,
<br>
<br>Bring back what we've forgot,
<br>
<br>just do your best, we'll do the rest,
<br>
<br>And learn until our brains all rot.
<br>
<br>Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the
<br>Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.
<br>Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they
<br>had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.
<br>
<br>"Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here!
<br>And now, bedtime. Off you trot!"
<br>
<br>The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the <b>chattering</b>  crowds,
<br>out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were
<br>like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He
<br>was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits
<br>along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice
<br>Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging
<br>tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their
<br>feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when
<br>they came to a sudden halt.
<br>
<br>A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as
<br>Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.
<br>
<br>"Peeves," Percy whispered to the first years. "A poltergeist." He raised
<br>his voice, "Peeves -- show yourself"
<br>
<br>A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.
<br>
<br>"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?"
<br>
<br>There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide
<br>mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking
<br>sticks.
<br>
<br>"Oooooooh!" he said, with an evil cackle. "Ickle Firsties! What fun!"
<br>
<br>He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.
<br>
<br>"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!" barked
<br>Percy.
<br>
<br>Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on
<br>Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as
<br>he passed.
<br>
<br>"You want to watch out for Peeves," said Percy, as they set off again.
<br>"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even
<br>listen to us prefects. Here we are."
<br>
<br>At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a
<br>pink silk dress.
<br>
<br>"Password?" she said. "Caput Draconis," said Percy, and the portrait
<br>swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled
<br>through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the
<br>Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.
<br>
<br>Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the
<br>boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were
<br>obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five
<br>four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had
<br>already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their
<br>pajamas and fell into bed.
<br>
<br>" Great food, <b>isn</b> 't it?" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings.
<br>"Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets."
<br>
<br>Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he
<br>fell asleep <b>almost</b>  at once.
<br>
<br>Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange
<br>dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to
<br>him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was
<br>his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it
<br>got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened
<br>painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with
<br>it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh
<br>became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke,
<br>sweating and shaking.
<br>
<br>He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he
<br>didn't remember the dream at all.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER EIGHT
<br>
<br>THE POTIONS MASTER
<br>
<br>There, look."
<br>
<br>"Where?"
<br>
<br>"Next to the tall kid with the red hair."
<br>
<br>"Wearing the glasses?"
<br>
<br>"Did you see his face?"
<br>
<br>"Did you see his scar?"
<br>
<br>Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next
<br>day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look
<br>at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring.
<br>Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on
<br>finding his way to classes.
<br>
<br>There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,
<br>sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different
<br>on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to
<br>remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you
<br>asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors
<br>that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It
<br>was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed
<br>to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit
<br>each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.
<br>
<br>The ghosts didn't help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of
<br>them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly
<br>Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right
<br>direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a
<br>trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would
<br>drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet,
<br>pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab
<br>your nose, and screech, "GOT YOUR CONK!"
<br>
<br>Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus
<br>Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their
<br>very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a
<br>door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds
<br>corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was
<br>sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening
<br>to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor
<br>Quirrell, who was passing.
<br>
<br>Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature
<br>with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the
<br>corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of
<br>line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds
<br>later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than
<br>anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly
<br>as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest
<br>ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.
<br>
<br>And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes
<br>themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out,
<br>than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.
<br>
<br>They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every
<br>Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the
<br>movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the
<br>greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little
<br>witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of
<br>all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.
<br>
<br>Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only
<br>one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old
<br>
<br>indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got
<br>up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on
<br>and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the
<br>Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.
<br>
<br>Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had
<br>to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their
<br>first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he
<br>gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to
<br>think she wasn't a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a
<br>talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.
<br>
<br>"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you
<br>will learn at Hogwarts," she said. "Anyone messing around in my class
<br>will leave and not come back. You have been warned."
<br>
<br>Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very
<br>impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they
<br>weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time.
<br>After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match
<br>and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson,
<br>only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor
<br>McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and
<br>gave Hermione a rare smile.
<br>
<br>The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense
<br><b>Against</b>  the <b>Dark</b>  Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of
<br>a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said
<br>was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be
<br>coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had
<br>been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of
<br>a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story.
<br>For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell
<br>had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about
<br>the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung
<br>around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed
<br>full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.
<br>
<br>Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone
<br>else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't
<br>had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to
<br>learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.
<br>
<br>Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to
<br>find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost
<br>once.
<br>
<br>"What have we got today?" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his
<br>porridge.
<br>
<br>"Double Potions with the Slytherins," said Ron. "Snape's Head of
<br>Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we'll be able to see
<br>if it's true."
<br>
<br>"Wish McGonagall favored us, " said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head
<br>of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge
<br>pile of homework the day before.
<br>
<br>Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but
<br>it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a
<br>hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast,
<br>circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters
<br>and packages onto their laps.
<br>
<br>Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to
<br>nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the
<br>owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered
<br>down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto
<br>Harry's plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy
<br>scrawl:
<br>
<br>
<br>Dear Harry,
<br>
<br>I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have
<br>a cup of tea with me around three?
<br>
<br>I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with
<br>Hedwig.
<br>
<br>Hagrid
<br>
<br>
<br>Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the
<br>back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
<br>
<br>It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because
<br>the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to
<br>him so far.
<br>
<br>At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor
<br>Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd
<br>been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- he hated him.
<br>
<br>Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder
<br>here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough
<br>without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.
<br>
<br>Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and
<br>like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.
<br>
<br>"Ah, Yes," he said softly, "Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity."
<br>
<br>Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their
<br>hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His
<br>eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth.
<br>They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.
<br>
<br>"You are here to learn the subtle science and <b>exact</b>  art of
<br>potionmaking," he began. He spoke in barely more than a <b>whisper</b> , but
<br>they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught
<br>every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a
<br>class silent without effort. "As there is little foolish wand-waving
<br>here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you
<br>will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with
<br>its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through
<br>human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.... I can teach
<br>you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren't
<br>as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach."
<br>
<br>More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks
<br>with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and
<br>looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.
<br>
<br>"Potter!" said Snape suddenly. "What would I get if I added powdered
<br>root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
<br>
<br>Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who
<br>looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had <b>shot</b>  into the air.
<br>
<br>"I don't know, sit," said Harry.
<br>
<br>Snape's lips curled into a sneer.
<br>
<br>"Tut, tut -- fame clearly <b>isn</b> 't everything."
<br>
<br>He ignored Hermione's hand.
<br>
<br>"Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me
<br>a bezoar?"
<br>
<br>Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without
<br>her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a
<br>bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were
<br>shaking with laughter.
<br>
<br>"I don't know, sit." "Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming,
<br>eh, Potter?" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those
<br>cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did
<br>Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs
<br>and Fungi?
<br>
<br>Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.
<br>
<br>"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?"
<br>
<br>At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon
<br>ceiling.
<br>
<br>"I don't know," said Harry quietly. "I think Hermione does, though, why
<br>don't you try her?"
<br>
<br>A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked.
<br>Snape, however, was not pleased.
<br>
<br>"Sit down," he snapped at Hermione. "For your information, Potter,
<br>asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as
<br>the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach
<br>of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and
<br>wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of
<br>aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?"
<br>
<br>There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise,
<br>Snape said, "And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your
<br>cheek, Potter."
<br>
<br>Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson
<br>continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a
<br>simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak,
<br>watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing
<br><b>almost</b>  everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just
<br>telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned
<br>slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the
<br>dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a
<br>twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor,
<br>burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was
<br>standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the
<br>potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils
<br>sprang up all over his arms and legs.
<br>
<br>"Idiot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one
<br>wave of his wand. "I suppose you added the porcupine quills before
<br>taking the cauldron off the fire?"
<br>
<br>Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.
<br>
<br>"Take him up to the hospital wing," Snape spat at Seamus. Then he
<br>rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.
<br>
<br>"You -- Potter -- why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought
<br>he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another
<br>point you've lost for Gryffindor."
<br>
<br>This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked
<br>him behind their cauldron.
<br>
<br>"Doi* push it," he muttered, "I've heard Snape can turn very nasty."
<br>
<br>As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind
<br>was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor
<br>in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? "Cheer up,"
<br>said Ron, "Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come
<br>and meet Hagrid with you?"
<br>
<br>At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the
<br>grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the
<br>forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the
<br>front door.
<br>
<br>When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and
<br>several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, "Back, Fang
<br>-- back."
<br>
<br>Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door
<br>open.
<br>
<br>"Hang on," he said. "Back, Fang."
<br>
<br>He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous
<br>black boarhound.
<br>
<br>There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the
<br>ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner
<br>stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.
<br>
<br>"Make yerselves at home," said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded
<br>straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was
<br>clearly not as fierce as he looked.
<br>
<br>"This is Ron," Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a
<br>large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
<br>
<br>"Another Weasley, eh?" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles. I spent
<br>half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest."
<br>
<br>The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that <b>almost</b>  broke their
<br>teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told
<br>Hagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry's
<br>knee and drooled all over his robes.
<br>
<br>Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch "that old git."
<br>
<br>"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang
<br>sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me
<br>everywhere? Can't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it."
<br>
<br>Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not
<br>to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.
<br>
<br>"But he seemed to really hate me."
<br>
<br>"Rubbish!" said Hagrid. "Why should he?"
<br>
<br>Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes
<br>when he said that.
<br>
<br>"How's yer brother Charlie?" Hagrid asked Ron. "I liked him a lot --
<br>great with animals."
<br>
<br>Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron
<br>told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a
<br>piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a
<br>cutting from the Daily Prophet:
<br>
<br>GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST
<br>
<br>Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July,
<br>widely believed to be the work of <b>Dark</b>  wizards or witches unknown.
<br>
<br>Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault
<br>that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.
<br>
<br>"But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if
<br>you know what's good for you," said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this
<br>afternoon.
<br>
<br>Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to
<br>rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date.
<br>
<br>"Hagrid!" said Harry, "that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!
<br>It might've been happening while we were there!"
<br>
<br>There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes
<br>this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the
<br>story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied
<br>earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and
<br>thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little
<br>package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?
<br>
<br>As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets
<br>weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry
<br>thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much
<br>to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package
<br>just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about
<br>Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER NINE
<br>
<br>THE MIDNIGHT DUEL
<br>
<br>Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley,
<br>but that was before he met Draco Malfoy.	Still, first-year
<br>Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to
<br>put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a
<br>notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan.
<br>Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and
<br>Slytherin	would be learning together.
<br>
<br>"Typical," said Harry darkly. "Just what I always wanted. To make a fool
<br>of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy."
<br>
<br>He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.
<br>
<br>"You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself," said Ron
<br>reasonably. "Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he
<br>is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk."
<br>
<br>Malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about
<br>first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long,
<br>boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping
<br>Muggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus
<br>Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the
<br>countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen
<br>about the time he'd <b>almost</b>  hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom.
<br>Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron
<br>had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their
<br>dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game
<br>with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron
<br>prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the
<br>players move.
<br>
<br>Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his
<br>grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had
<br>good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary <b>number</b>  of
<br>accidents even with both feet on the ground.
<br>
<br>Hermione Granger was <b>almost</b>  as nervous about flying as Neville was. This
<br>was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book -- not that she
<br>hadn't tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with
<br>flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through
<br>the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for
<br>anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but
<br>everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted
<br>by the arrival of the mail.
<br>
<br>Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that
<br>Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy's eagle owl was
<br>always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened
<br>gloatingly at the Slytherin table.
<br>
<br>A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He
<br>opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large
<br>marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.
<br>
<br>"It's a Remembrall!" he explained. "Gran knows I forget things -- this
<br>tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it
<br>tight like this and if it <b>turns</b>  red -- oh..." His face fell, because the
<br>Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet,
<br>
<br>"You've forgotten something..."
<br>
<br>Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy,
<br>who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his
<br>hand.
<br>
<br>Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason
<br>to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble
<br>quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.
<br>
<br>"What's going on?"
<br>
<br>"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor."
<br>
<br>Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.
<br>
<br>"Just looking," he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind
<br>him.
<br>
<br>At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors
<br>hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying
<br>lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their
<br>feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn
<br>on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees
<br>were swaying darkly in the distance.
<br>
<br>The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying
<br>in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley
<br>complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to
<br>vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.
<br>
<br>Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and
<br>yellow eyes like a hawk.
<br>
<br>"Well, what are you all waiting for?" she barked. "Everyone stand by a
<br>broomstick. Come on, hurry up."
<br>
<br>Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck
<br>out at odd angles.
<br>
<br>"Stick out your right hand over your broom," called Madam Hooch at the
<br>front, "and say 'Up!"'
<br>
<br>"UPF everyone shouted.
<br>
<br>Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few
<br>that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and
<br>Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell
<br>when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's
<br>voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the
<br>ground.
<br>
<br>Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding
<br>off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.
<br>Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it
<br>wrong for years.
<br>
<br>"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard," said
<br>Madam Hooch. "Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come
<br>straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three
<br>-- two --"
<br>
<br>But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the
<br>ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's
<br>lips.
<br>
<br>"Come back, boy!" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a
<br>cork <b>shot</b>  out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his
<br>scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp,
<br>slip sideways off the broom and --
<br>
<br>WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass
<br>in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and
<br>started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.
<br>
<br>Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.
<br>
<br>"Broken wrist," Harry heard her mutter. "Come on, boy -- it's all right,
<br>up you get.".
<br>
<br>She turned to the rest of the class.
<br>
<br>"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You
<br>leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before
<br>you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear."
<br>
<br>Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with
<br>Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.
<br>
<br>No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.
<br>
<br>"Did you see his face, the great lump?"
<br>
<br>The other Slytherins joined in.
<br>
<br>"Shut up, Malfoy," snapped Parvati Patil.
<br>
<br>"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced
<br>Slytherin girl. "Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies,
<br>Parvati."
<br>
<br>"Look!" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the
<br>grass. "It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him."
<br>
<br>The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.
<br>
<br>"Give that here, Malfoy," said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking
<br>to watch.
<br>
<br>Malfoy smiled nastily.
<br>
<br>"I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about --
<br>up a tree?"
<br>
<br>"Give it here!" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick
<br>and taken off. He hadn't been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level
<br>with the topmost branches of an oak he called, "Come and get it,
<br>Potter!"
<br>
<br>Harry grabbed his broom.
<br>
<br>"No!" shouted Hermione Granger. "Madam Hooch told us not to move --
<br>you'll get us all into trouble."
<br>
<br>Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom
<br>and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed
<br>through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of
<br>fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being
<br>taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up
<br>a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls
<br>back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.
<br>
<br>He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked
<br>stunned.
<br>
<br>"Give it here," Harry called, "or I'll knock you off that broom!" "Oh,
<br>yeah?" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.
<br>
<br>Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom
<br>tightly in both hands, and it <b>shot</b>  toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy
<br>only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and
<br>held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.
<br>
<br>"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy," Harry called.
<br>
<br>The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.
<br>
<br>"Catch it if you can, then!" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball
<br>high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.
<br>
<br>Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and
<br>then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down
<br>-- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball
<br>-- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people
<br>watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he
<br>caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled
<br>gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.
<br>
<br>"HARRY POTTER!"
<br>
<br>His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was
<br>running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.
<br>
<br>"Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --"
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall was <b>almost</b>  speechless with shock, and her glasses
<br>flashed furiously, "-- how dare you -- might have broken your neck --"
<br>
<br>"It wasn't his fault, Professor --"
<br>
<br>"Be quiet, Miss Patil
<br>
<br>"But Malfoy --"
<br>
<br>"That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now."
<br>
<br>Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he
<br>left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward
<br>the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to
<br>say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong
<br>with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even
<br>looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't
<br>even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What
<br>would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?
<br>
<br>Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor
<br>McGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched
<br>along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was
<br>taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to
<br>stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His
<br>stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming
<br>wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag.
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door
<br>and poked her head inside.
<br>
<br>"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?"
<br>
<br>Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on
<br>him?
<br>
<br>But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out
<br>of Flitwicles class looking confused.
<br>
<br>"Follow me, you two," said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up
<br>the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.
<br>
<br>"In here."
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except
<br>for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.
<br>
<br>"Out, Peeves!" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which
<br>clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed
<br>the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.
<br>
<br>"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I've found you a Seeker."
<br>
<br>Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight.
<br>
<br>"Are you serious, Professor?"
<br>
<br>"Absolutely," said Professor McGonagall crisply. "The boy's a natural.
<br>I've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a
<br>broomstick, Potter?"
<br>
<br>Harry nodded silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he
<br>didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming
<br>back to his legs.
<br>
<br>"He caught that thing in his hand after a <b>fifty</b> -foot dive," Professor
<br>McGonagall told Wood. "Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley
<br>couldn't have done it."
<br>
<br>Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.
<br>
<br>"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?" he asked excitedly.
<br>
<br>"Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team," Professor McGonagall explained.
<br>
<br>"He's just the build for a Seeker, too," said Wood, now walking around
<br>Harry and staring at him. "Light -- speedy -- we'll have to get him a
<br>decent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven,
<br>I'd say."
<br>
<br>I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the
<br>first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year.
<br>Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape
<br>in the face for weeks...."
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.
<br>
<br>"I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind
<br>about punishing you."
<br>
<br>Then she suddenly smiled.
<br>
<br>"Your father would have been proud," she said. "He was an excellent
<br>Quidditch player himself."
<br>
<br>"You're joking."
<br>
<br>It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened
<br>when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of
<br>steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about
<br>it.
<br>
<br>"Seeker?" he said. "But first years never -- you must be the youngest
<br>house player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his
<br>mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the
<br>afternoon. "Wood told me."
<br>
<br>Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.
<br>
<br>"I start training next week," said Harry. "Only don't tell anyone, Wood
<br>wants to keep it a secret."
<br>
<br>Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and
<br>hurried over.
<br>
<br>"Well done," said George in a low voice. "Wood told us. We're on the
<br>team too -- Beaters."
<br>
<br>"I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,"
<br>said Fred. "We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is
<br>going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was <b>almost</b>  skipping
<br>when he told us."
<br>
<br>"Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret
<br>passageway out of the school."
<br>
<br>"Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found
<br>in our first week. See you."
<br>
<br>Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome
<br>turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
<br>
<br>"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the
<br>Muggles?"
<br>
<br>"You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got
<br>your little friends with you," said Harry coolly. There was of course
<br>nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was
<br>full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their
<br>knuckles and scowl.
<br>
<br>"I'd take you on anytime on my own," said Malfoy. "Tonight, if you want.
<br>Wizard's duel. Wands only -- no contact. What's the matter? Never heard
<br>of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?"
<br>
<br>"Of course he has," said Ron, wheeling around. "I'm his second, who's
<br>yours?"
<br>
<br>Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.
<br>
<br>"Crabbe," he said. "Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy
<br>room; that's always unlocked."
<br>
<br>When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. "What is a
<br>wizard's duel?" said Harry. "And what do you mean, you're my second?"
<br>
<br>"Well, a second's there to take over if you die," said Ron casually,
<br>getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry's
<br>face, he added quickly, "But people only die in proper duels, you know,
<br>with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send
<br>sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real
<br>damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway."
<br>
<br>"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?"
<br>
<br>"Throw it away and punch him on the nose," Ron suggested. "Excuse me."
<br>
<br>They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.
<br>
<br>"Can't a person eat in peace in this place?" said Ron.
<br>
<br>Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.
<br>
<br>"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying --"
<br>
<br>"Bet you could," Ron muttered.
<br>
<br>"--and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the
<br>points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be.
<br>It's really very selfish of you."
<br>
<br>"And it's really none of your business," said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Good-bye," said Ron.
<br>
<br>All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day,
<br>Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus
<br>falling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing). Ron had
<br>spent all evening giving him advice such as "If he tries to curse you,
<br>you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to block them."
<br>There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or
<br>Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another
<br>school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoys sneering face kept looming
<br>up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoy
<br>face-to-face. He couldn't miss it.
<br>
<br>"Half-past eleven," Ron muttered at last, "we'd better go."
<br>
<br>They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across
<br>the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor
<br>common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning
<br>all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had <b>almost</b>  reached
<br>the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, "I
<br>can't believe you're going to do this, Harry."
<br>
<br>A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe
<br>and a frown.
<br>
<br>"You!" said Ron furiously. "Go back to bed!"
<br>
<br>"I <b>almost</b>  told your brother," Hermione snapped, "Percy -- he's a
<br>prefect, he'd put a stop to this."
<br>
<br>Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering.
<br>
<br>"Come on," he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady
<br>and climbed through the hole.
<br>
<br>Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through
<br>the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.
<br>
<br>"Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I
<br>don't want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the
<br>points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching
<br>Spells."
<br>
<br>"Go away." "All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said
<br>when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so --"
<br>
<br>But what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned to the
<br>portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an
<br>empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione
<br>was locked out of Gryffindor tower.
<br>
<br>"Now what am I going to do?" she asked shrilly.
<br>
<br>"That's your problem," said Ron. "We've got to go, we 3 re going to be
<br>late."
<br>
<br>They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up
<br>with them.
<br>
<br>"I'm coming with you," she said.
<br>
<br>"You are not."
<br>
<br>"D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?
<br>If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying
<br>to stop you, and you can back me up."
<br>
<br>"You've got some nerve --" said Ron loudly.
<br>
<br>"Shut up, both of you!" said Harry sharply. I heard something."
<br>
<br>It was a sort of snuffling.
<br>
<br>"Mrs. Norris?" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.
<br>
<br>It wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor,
<br>fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.
<br>
<br>"Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't
<br>remember the new password to get in to bed."
<br>
<br>"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password's 'Pig snout' but it won't
<br>help you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere."
<br>
<br>"How's your arm?" said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Fine," said Neville, showing them. "Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a
<br>minute."
<br>
<br>"Good - well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you
<br>later --"
<br>
<br>"Don't leave me!" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, "I don't want to
<br>stay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already."
<br>
<br>Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and
<br>Neville.
<br>
<br>"If either of you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that
<br>Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.
<br>
<br>Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the
<br>Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned
<br>them all forward.
<br>
<br>They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the
<br>high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs.
<br>Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor
<br>and tiptoed toward the trophy room.
<br>
<br>Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered
<br>where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues
<br>winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls,
<br>keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took
<br>out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes
<br>crept by.
<br>
<br>"He's late, maybe he's chickened out," Ron whispered.
<br>
<br>Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised
<br>his wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasn't Malfoy.
<br>
<br>"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner."
<br>
<br>It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly
<br>at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried
<br>silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice. Neville's robes had
<br>barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy
<br>room.
<br>
<br>"They're in here somewhere," they heard him mutter, "probably hiding."
<br>
<br>"This way!" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to
<br>creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch
<br>getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke
<br>into a run -he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of
<br>them toppled right into a suit of armor.
<br>
<br>The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.
<br>
<br>"RUN!" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not
<br>looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the
<br>doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead,
<br>without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped
<br>through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled
<br>along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was
<br>miles from the trophy room.
<br>
<br>"I think we've lost him," Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall
<br>and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and
<br>spluttering.
<br>
<br>I -- told -you," Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest,
<br>"I -- told -- you."
<br>
<br>"We've got to get back to Gryffindor tower," said Ron, "quickly as
<br>possible."
<br>
<br>"Malfoy tricked you," Hermione said to Harry. "You realize that, don't
<br>you? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to
<br>be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off."
<br>
<br>Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her
<br>that.
<br>
<br>"Let's go."
<br>
<br>It wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen
<br>paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a
<br>classroom in front of them.
<br>
<br>It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.
<br>
<br>"Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you'll get us thrown out."
<br>
<br>Peeves cackled.
<br>
<br>"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty,
<br>naughty, you'll get caughty."
<br>
<br>"Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please."
<br>
<br>"Should tell Filch, I should," said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his
<br>eyes glittered wickedly. "It's for your own good, you know."
<br>
<br>"Get out of the way," snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a
<br>big mistake.
<br>
<br>"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!" Peeves bellowed, "STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE
<br>CHARMS CORRIDOR"
<br>
<br>Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the
<br>corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked.
<br>
<br>"This is it!" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, "We're
<br>done for! This is the end!" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as
<br>fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts.
<br>
<br>"Oh, move over," Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the
<br>lock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!"
<br>
<br>The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut
<br>it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.
<br>
<br>"Which way did they go, Peeves?" Filch was saying. "Quick, tell me."
<br>
<br>"Say 'please."'
<br>
<br>"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?"
<br>
<br>"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please," said Peeves in his
<br>annoying singsong voice.
<br>
<br>"All right -please."
<br>
<br>"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say
<br>please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing
<br>away and Filch cursing in rage.
<br>
<br>"He thinks this door is locked," Harry whispered. "I think we'll be okay
<br>-- get off, Neville!" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of
<br>Harry's bathrobe for the last minute. "What?"
<br>
<br>Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he
<br>was sure he'd walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of
<br>everything that had happened so far.
<br>
<br>They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The
<br>forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was
<br>forbidden.
<br>
<br>They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that
<br>filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads.
<br>Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching
<br>
<br>and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging
<br>in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.
<br>
<br>It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry
<br>knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their
<br>sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting
<br>over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
<br>
<br>Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he'd take
<br>Filch.
<br>
<br>They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they
<br><b>almost</b>  flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look
<br>for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they
<br>hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible
<br>between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they
<br>reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.
<br>
<br>"Where on earth have you all been?" she asked, looking at their
<br>bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.
<br>
<br>"Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout," panted Harry, and the
<br>portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and
<br>collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.
<br>
<br>It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked
<br>as if he'd never speak again.
<br>
<br>"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up
<br>in a school?" said Ron finally. "If any dog needs exercise, that one
<br>does."
<br>
<br>Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. "You
<br>don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?" she snapped. "Didn't you see
<br>what it was standing on.
<br>
<br>"The floor?" Harry suggested. "I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too
<br>busy with its heads."
<br>
<br>"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously
<br>guarding something."
<br>
<br>She stood up, glaring at them.
<br>
<br>I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed --
<br>or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed."
<br>
<br>Ron stared after her, his mouth open.
<br>
<br>"No, we don't mind," he said. "You'd think we dragged her along,
<br>wouldn't you.
<br>
<br>But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed
<br>back into bed. The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said?
<br>Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to
<br>hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.
<br>
<br>It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package
<br>from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER TEN
<br>
<br>HALLOWEEN
<br>
<br>Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were
<br>still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful.
<br>Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the
<br>three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite
<br>keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the
<br>package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and
<br>they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy
<br>protection. "It's either really valuable or really dangerous," said Ron.
<br>"Or both," said Harry.
<br>
<br>
<br>But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it
<br>was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what
<br>it was without further clues.
<br>
<br>Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay
<br>underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never
<br>going near the dog again.
<br>
<br>Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a
<br>bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really
<br>wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great
<br>delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.
<br>
<br>As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention
<br>was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech
<br>owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in
<br>this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped
<br>it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had
<br>hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top
<br>of the parcel.
<br>
<br>Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:
<br>
<br>
<br>DO <b>NOT</b>  OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.
<br>
<br>It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody
<br>knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood
<br>will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your
<br>first training session.
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall
<br>
<br>Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to
<br>read.
<br>
<br>"A Nimbus Two Thousand!" Ron moaned enviously. "I've never even touched
<br>one."
<br>
<br>They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private
<br>before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they
<br>found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the
<br>package from Harry and felt it.
<br>
<br>"That's a broomstick," he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture
<br>of jealousy and spite on his face. "You'll be in for it this time,
<br>Potter, first years aren't allowed them."
<br>
<br>Ron couldn't resist it.
<br>
<br>"It's not any old broomstick," he said, "it's a Nimbus Two Thousand.
<br>What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?" Ron
<br>grinned at Harry. "Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same
<br>league as the Nimbus."
<br>
<br>"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the
<br>handle," Malfoy snapped back. "I suppose you and your brothers have to
<br>save up twig by twig."
<br>
<br>Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow.
<br>
<br>"Not arguing, I hope, boys?" he squeaked.
<br>
<br>"Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor," said Malfoy quickly.
<br>
<br>"Yes, yes, that's right," said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.
<br>"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances,
<br>Potter. And what model is it?"
<br>
<br>"A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit," said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the
<br>look of horror on Malfoy's face. "And it's really thanks to Malfoy here
<br>that I've got it," he added.
<br>
<br>Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's
<br>obvious rage and confusion. "Well, it's true," Harry chortled as they
<br>reached the top of the marble staircase, "If he hadn't stolen Neville's
<br>Remembrall I wouln't be on the team...."
<br>
<br>"So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?" came an
<br>angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs,
<br>looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand.
<br>
<br>"I thought you weren't speaking to us?" said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Yes, don't stop now," said Ron, "it's doing us so much good."
<br>
<br>Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.
<br>
<br>Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It
<br>kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying
<br>under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be
<br>learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without
<br>noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap
<br>the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.
<br>
<br>"Wow," Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread.
<br>
<br>Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it
<br>looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long
<br>tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold
<br>near the top.
<br>
<br>As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the
<br>dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium
<br>before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that
<br>the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end
<br>of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They
<br>reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle
<br>
<br>children blew bubbles through, except that they were <b>fifty</b>  feet high.
<br>
<br>Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick
<br>and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out
<br>of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two
<br>Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.
<br>
<br>"Hey, Potter, come down!'
<br>
<br>Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his
<br>arm. Harry landed next to him.
<br>
<br>"Very nice," said Wood, his eyes glinting. "I see what McGonagall
<br>meant... you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules
<br>this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week."
<br>
<br>He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.
<br>
<br>"Right," said Wood. "Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even
<br>if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side.
<br>Three of them are called Chasers."
<br>
<br>"Three Chasers," Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball
<br>about the size of a soccer ball.
<br>
<br>"This ball's called the Quaffle," said Wood. "The Chasers throw the
<br>Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to
<br>score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the
<br>hoops. Follow me?"
<br>
<br>"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,"
<br>Harry recited. "So -- that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with
<br>six hoops, <b>isn</b> 't it?"
<br>
<br>"What's basketball?" said Wood curiously. "Never mind," said Harry
<br>quickly.
<br>
<br>"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper -I'm
<br>Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other
<br>team from scoring."
<br>
<br>"Three Chasers, one Keeper," said Harry, who was determined to remember
<br>it all. "And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are
<br>they for?" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.
<br>
<br>"I'll show you now," said Wood. "Take this."
<br>
<br>He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.
<br>
<br>"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do," Wood said. "These two are
<br>the Bludgers."
<br>
<br>He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than
<br>the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to
<br>escape the straps holding them inside the box.
<br>
<br>"Stand back," Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the
<br>Bludgers.
<br>
<br>At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at
<br>Harry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking
<br>his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around
<br>their heads and then <b>shot</b>  at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to
<br>pin it to the ground.
<br>
<br>"See?" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate
<br>and strapping it down safely. "The Bludgers rocket around, trying to
<br>knock players off their brooms. That's why you have two Beaters on each
<br>team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it's their job to protect their
<br>side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So
<br>-- think you've got all that?"
<br>
<br>"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the
<br>goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team," Harry
<br>reeled off.
<br>
<br>"Very good," said Wood.
<br>
<br>"Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?" Harry asked, hoping he
<br>sounded offhand.
<br>
<br>"Never at Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse
<br>than that. Now, the last member of the team is the
<br>
<br>Seeker. That's you. And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the
<br>Bludgers unless they crack my head open."
<br>
<br>"Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I
<br>mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves."
<br>
<br>Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.
<br>Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size
<br>of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver
<br>wings.
<br>
<br>"This," said Wood, "is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important
<br>ball of the lot. It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and
<br>difficult to see. It's the Seeker's job to catch it. You've got to weave
<br>in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it
<br>before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the
<br>Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and <b>fifty</b>  points, so they
<br>
<br>nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of
<br>Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages
<br>-- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on
<br>substitutes so the players could get some sleep. "Well, that's it -- any
<br>questions?"
<br>
<br>Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was
<br>doing it that was going to be the problem.
<br>
<br>"We won't practice with the Snitch yet," said Wood, carefully shutting
<br>it back inside the crate, "it's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try
<br>you out with a few of these."
<br>
<br>He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few
<br>minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf
<br>balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.
<br>
<br>Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an
<br>hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.
<br>
<br>"That Quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year," said Wood happily
<br>as they trudged back up to the castle. "I wouldn't be surprised if you
<br>turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for
<br>England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons."
<br>
<br>Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice
<br>three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly
<br>believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two
<br>months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His
<br>lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had
<br>mastered the basics.
<br>
<br>On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin
<br>wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced
<br>in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly,
<br>something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make
<br>Neville's toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the
<br>class into pairs to practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which
<br>was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron,
<br>however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell
<br>whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn't spoken to
<br>either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.
<br>
<br>"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!"
<br>squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as
<br>usual. "Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic
<br>words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio,
<br>who said 's' instead of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a
<br>buffalo on his chest."
<br>
<br>It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the
<br>feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the
<br>desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and
<br>set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat.
<br>
<br>Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck.
<br>
<br>"Wingardium Leviosa!" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.
<br>
<br>"You're saying it wrong," Harry heard Hermione snap. "It's Wing-gar-dium
<br>Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long."
<br>
<br>
<br>"You do it, then, if you're so clever," Ron snarled.
<br>
<br>Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said,
<br>"Wingardium Leviosa!"
<br>
<br>Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their
<br>heads.
<br>
<br>"Oh, well done!" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. "Everyone see here,
<br>Miss Granger's done it!"
<br>
<br>Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. "It's no wonder no
<br>one can stand her," he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the
<br>crowded corridor, "she's a nightmare, honestly. "
<br>
<br>Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione.
<br>Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she
<br>was in tears.
<br>
<br>"I think she heard you."
<br>
<br>"So?" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. "She must've noticed
<br>she's got no friends."
<br>
<br>Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all
<br>afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast,
<br>Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that
<br>Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone.
<br>Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had
<br>entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out
<br>of their minds.
<br>
<br>A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a
<br>thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the
<br>candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the
<br>golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.
<br>
<br>Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell
<br>came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.
<br>Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped
<br>against the table, and gasped, "Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you
<br>ought to know."
<br>
<br>He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
<br>
<br>There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from
<br>the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.
<br>
<br>"Prefects," he rumbled, "lead your Houses back to the dormitories
<br>immediately!"
<br>
<br>Percy was in his element.
<br>
<br>"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if
<br>you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years
<br>coming through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!"
<br>
<br>"How could a troll get in?" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.
<br>
<br>"Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid," said Ron. "Maybe
<br>Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke."
<br>
<br>They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.
<br>As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry
<br>suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.
<br>
<br>"I've just thought -- Hermione."
<br>
<br>"What about her?"
<br>
<br>"She doesn't know about the troll."
<br>
<br>Ron bit his lip.
<br>
<br>"Oh, all right," he snapped. "But Percy'd better not see us."
<br>
<br>Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped
<br>down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls'
<br>bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick
<br>footsteps behind them.
<br>
<br>"Percy!" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.
<br>
<br>Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the
<br>corridor and disappeared from view.
<br>
<br>"What's he doing?" Harry whispered. "Why <b>isn</b> 't he down in the dungeons
<br>with the rest of the teachers?"
<br>
<br>"Search me."
<br>
<br>Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's
<br>fading footsteps.
<br>
<br>"He's heading for the third floor," Harry said, but Ron held up his
<br>hand.
<br>
<br>"Can you smell something?"
<br>
<br>Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old
<br>socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.
<br>
<br>And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of
<br>gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left,
<br>something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and
<br>watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.
<br>
<br>It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite
<br>gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head
<br>perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks
<br>with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was
<br>holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its
<br>arms were so long.
<br>
<br>The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its
<br>long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.
<br>
<br>"The keys in the lock," Harry muttered. "We could lock it in."
<br>
<br>"Good idea," said Ron nervously.
<br>
<br>They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't
<br>about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the
<br>key, slam the door, and lock it.
<br>
<br>'Yes!"
<br>
<br>Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but
<br>as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts
<br>stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber
<br>they'd just chained up.
<br>
<br>"Oh, no," said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.
<br>
<br>"It's the girls' bathroom!" Harry gasped.
<br>
<br>"Hermione!" they said together.
<br>
<br>It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?
<br>Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key,
<br>fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.
<br>
<br>Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if
<br>she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the
<br>sinks off the walls as it went.
<br>
<br>"Confuse it!" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he
<br>threw it as hard as he could against the wall.
<br>
<br>The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking
<br>stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw
<br>Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it
<br>went.
<br>
<br>"Oy, pea-brain!" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he
<br>threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe
<br>hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning
<br>its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.
<br>
<br>"Come on, run, run!" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward
<br>the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall,
<br>her mouth open with terror.
<br>
<br>The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It
<br>roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to
<br>escape.
<br>
<br>Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He
<br>took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the
<br>troll's neck from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there,
<br>but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its
<br>nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped -- it
<br>had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.
<br>
<br>Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry
<br>clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him
<br>off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.
<br>
<br>Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand --
<br>not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first <b>spell</b> 
<br>that came into his head: "Wingardium Leviosa!"
<br>
<br>The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into
<br>the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto
<br>its owner's head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its
<br>face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.
<br>
<br>Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was
<br>standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.
<br>
<br>It was Hermione who spoke first.
<br>
<br>"Is it -- dead?"
<br>
<br>I don't think so," said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out."
<br>
<br>He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered
<br>in what looked like lumpy gray glue.
<br>
<br>"Urgh -- troll boogers."
<br>
<br>He wiped it on the troll's trousers.
<br>
<br>A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.
<br>They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course,
<br>someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A
<br>moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room,
<br>closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell
<br>took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly
<br>down on a toilet, clutching his heart.
<br>
<br>Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and
<br>Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white.
<br>Hopes of winning <b>fifty</b>  points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's
<br>mind.
<br>
<br>"What on earth were you thinking of?" said Professor McGonagall, with
<br>cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with
<br>his wand in the air. "You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in
<br>your dormitory?"
<br>
<br>Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He
<br>wished Ron would put his wand down.
<br>
<br>Then a small voice came out of the shadows.
<br>
<br>"Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me."
<br>
<br>"Miss Granger!"
<br>
<br>Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.
<br>
<br>I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it
<br>on my own -- you know, because I've read all about them."
<br>
<br>Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a
<br>teacher? "If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand
<br>up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have
<br>time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they
<br>arrived."
<br>
<br>Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.
<br>
<br>"Well -- in that case..." said Professor McGonagall, staring at the
<br>three of them, "Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of
<br>tackling a mountain troll on your own?"
<br>
<br>Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last
<br>person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending
<br>she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started
<br>handing out sweets.
<br>
<br>"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this," said
<br>Professor McGonagall. "I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt
<br>at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing
<br>the feast in their houses."
<br>
<br>Hermione left.
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
<br>
<br>"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have
<br>taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five
<br>points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go."
<br>
<br>They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had
<br>climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the
<br>troll, quite apart from anything else.
<br>
<br>"We should have gotten more than ten points," Ron grumbled.
<br>
<br>"Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's."
<br>
<br>"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that," Ron admitted. "Mind
<br>you, we did save her."
<br>
<br>"She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with
<br>her," Harry reminded him.
<br>
<br>They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.
<br>
<br>"Pig snout," they said and entered.
<br>
<br>The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that
<br>had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting
<br>for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking
<br>at each other, they all said "Thanks," and hurried off to get plates.
<br>
<br>But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are
<br>some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and
<br>knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER ELEVEN
<br>
<br>QUIDDITCH
<br>
<br>As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains
<br>around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every
<br>morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the
<br>upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled
<br>up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous
<br>beaverskin boots.
<br>
<br>The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in
<br>his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If
<br>Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house
<br>championship.
<br>
<br>Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as
<br>their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news
<br>that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know
<br>which was worse -- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people
<br>telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.
<br>
<br>It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn't
<br>know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what
<br>with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She
<br>had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a
<br>very interesting read.
<br>
<br>Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a
<br>Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup
<br>match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest
<br>players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to
<br>them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had
<br>been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.
<br>
<br>Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry
<br>and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer
<br>for it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them
<br>were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured
<br>them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar.
<br>They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape
<br>crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry,
<br>Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view;
<br>they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about
<br>their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen
<br>the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off
<br>anyway.
<br>
<br>"What's that you've got there, Potter?"
<br>
<br>It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.
<br>
<br>"Library books are not to be taken outside the school," said Snape.
<br>"Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor."
<br>
<br>"He's just made that rule up," Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped
<br>away. "Wonder what's wrong with his leg?"
<br>
<br>"Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him," said Ron bitterly.
<br>
<br>The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and
<br>Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and
<br>Ron's Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy ("How will
<br>you learn?"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right
<br>answers anyway.
<br>
<br>Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take
<br>his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of
<br>Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if
<br>he could have it.
<br>
<br>"Better you than me," they said together, but Harry had an idea that
<br>Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.
<br>
<br>He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer.
<br>He knocked again. Nothing.
<br>
<br>Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed
<br>the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his eyes.
<br>
<br>Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above
<br>his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing
<br>Snape bandages.
<br>
<br>"Blasted thing*," Snape was saying. "How are you supposed to keep your
<br>eyes on all three heads at once?"
<br>
<br>Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but --
<br>
<br>"POTTER!"
<br>
<br>Snape's face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to
<br>hide his leg. Harry gulped.
<br>
<br>"I just wondered if I could have my book back."
<br>
<br>"GET OUT! OUT!"
<br>
<br>Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He
<br>sprinted back upstairs.
<br>
<br>"Did you get it?" Ron asked as Harry joined them. "What's the matter?"
<br>
<br>In a low <b>whisper</b> , Harry told them what he'd seen.
<br>
<br>"You know what this means?" he finished breathlessly. "He tried to get
<br>past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That's where he was going when
<br>we saw him -- he's after whatever it's guarding! And Id bet my
<br>broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!"
<br>
<br>Hermione's eyes were wide.
<br>
<br>"No -- he wouldn't, she said. "I know he's not very nice, but he
<br>wouldn't try and <b>steal</b>  something Dumbledore was keeping safe."
<br>
<br>"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,"
<br>snapped Ron. "I'm with Harry. I wouldn't put anything past Snape. But
<br>what's he after? What's that dog guarding?"
<br>
<br>Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville
<br>was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn't sleep. He tried to empty his mind
<br>-- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a
<br>few hours -- but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his
<br>leg wasn't easy to forget.
<br>
<br>The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of
<br>the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of
<br>everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.
<br>
<br>"You've got to eat some breakfast."
<br>
<br>"I don't want anything."
<br>
<br>"Just a bit of toast," wheedled Hermione.
<br>
<br>"I'm not hungry."
<br>
<br>Harry felt terrible. In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field.
<br>
<br>"Harry, you need your strength," said Seamus Finnigan. "Seekers are
<br>always the ones who get clobbered by the other team."
<br>
<br>"Thanks, Seamus," said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his
<br>sausages.
<br>
<br>By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around
<br>the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be
<br>raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going
<br>on sometimes.
<br>
<br>Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in
<br>the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on
<br>one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and
<br>Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion
<br>underneath. Then Hermione had performed a <b>tricky</b>  little charm so that
<br>the paint flashed different colors.
<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were
<br>changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing
<br>in green).
<br>
<br>Wood cleared his throat for silence.
<br>
<br>"Okay, men," he said.
<br>
<br>"And women," said Chaser Angelina Johnson.
<br>
<br>"And women," Wood agreed. "This is it."
<br>
<br>"The big one," said Fred Weasley.
<br>
<br>"The one we've all been waiting for," said George.
<br>
<br>"We know Oliver's speech by heart," Fred told Harry, "we were on the
<br>team last year."
<br>
<br>"Shut up, you two," said Wood. "This is the best team Gryffindor's had
<br>in years. We're going to win. I know it."
<br>
<br>He glared at them all as if to say, "Or else."
<br>
<br>"Right. It's time. Good luck, all of you."
<br>
<br>Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his
<br>knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.
<br>
<br>Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting
<br>for the two teams, her broom in her hand.
<br>
<br>"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you," she said, once they were all
<br>gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking
<br>particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry
<br>thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the
<br>corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing
<br>Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.
<br>
<br>"Mount your brooms, please."
<br>
<br>Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.
<br>
<br>Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.
<br>
<br>Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. "And the
<br>Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor -- what
<br>an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too --"
<br>
<br>"JORDAN!"
<br>
<br>"Sorry, Professor."
<br>
<br>The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the
<br>match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
<br>
<br>"And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet,
<br>a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve -- back to
<br>Johnson and -- no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin
<br>Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying
<br>like an eagle up there -- he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent
<br>move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle --
<br>that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint,
<br>off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of
<br>the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that's
<br>Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a
<br>second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell
<br>which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in
<br>possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she's
<br>really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead
<br>-- come on, now, Angelina -- Keeper Bletchley dives -- misses --
<br>GRYFFINDORS SCORE!"
<br>
<br>Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the
<br>Slytherins.
<br>
<br>"Budge up there, move along."
<br>
<br>"Hagrid!"
<br>
<br>Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join
<br>them.
<br>
<br>"Bin watchin' from me hut," said Hagrid, patting a large pair of
<br>binoculars around his neck, "But it <b>isn</b> 't the same as bein' in the
<br>crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?"
<br>
<br>"Nope," said Ron. "Harry hasn't had much to do yet."
<br>
<br>"Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin'," said Hagrid, raising his
<br>binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.
<br>
<br>Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for
<br>some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood's game plan.
<br>
<br>"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch," Wood had
<br>said. "We don't want you attacked before you have to be."
<br>
<br>When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to
<br>let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch.
<br>Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection
<br>from one of the Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to
<br>come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry
<br>dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.
<br>
<br>"All right there, Harry?" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger
<br>furiously toward Marcus Flint.
<br>
<br>"Slytherin in possession," Lee Jordan was saying, "Chaser Pucey ducks
<br>two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the --
<br>wait a moment -- was that the Snitch?"
<br>
<br>A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too
<br>busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his
<br>left ear.
<br>
<br>Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the
<br>streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck
<br>and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -all the Chasers seemed to have
<br>forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to
<br>watch.
<br>
<br>Harry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings
<br>fluttering, darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed --
<br>
<br>WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint
<br>had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry
<br>holding on for dear life.
<br>
<br>"Foul!" screamed the Gryffindors.
<br>
<br>Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free <b>shot</b>  at the
<br>goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the
<br>Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.
<br>
<br>Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, "Send him off, ref! Red
<br>card!"
<br>
<br>"What are you talking about, Dean?" said Ron.
<br>
<br>"Red card!" said Dean furiously. "In soccer you get shown the red card
<br>and you're out of the game!"
<br>
<br>"But this <b>isn</b> 't soccer, Dean," Ron reminded him.
<br>
<br>Hagrid, however, was on Dean's side.
<br>
<br>"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the
<br>air."
<br>
<br>Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.
<br>
<br>"So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating
<br>
<br>"Jordan!" growled Professor McGonagall.
<br>
<br>"I mean, after that open and revolting foul
<br>
<br>'Jordan, I'm warning you --"
<br>
<br>"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which
<br>could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by
<br>Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor
<br>still in possession."
<br>
<br>It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously
<br>past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening
<br>lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped
<br>the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He'd never felt
<br>anything like that.
<br>
<br>It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him
<br>off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their
<br>riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal- posts
<br>-- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he
<br>realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn't
<br>turn it. He couldn't direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the
<br>air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that
<br><b>almost</b>  unseated him.
<br>
<br>Lee was still commentating.
<br>
<br>"Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet --
<br>passes Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose
<br>-- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no...
<br>
<br>The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry's
<br>broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying- him slowly higher, away
<br>from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.
<br>
<br>"Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing," Hagrid mumbled. He stared through
<br>his binoculars. "If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd lost control of
<br>his broom... but he can't have...."
<br>
<br>Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His
<br>broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to
<br>hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given a wild
<br>jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on
<br>with only one hand.
<br>
<br>"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?" Seamus whispered.
<br>
<br>"Can't have," Hagrid said, his voice shaking. "Can't nothing interfere
<br>with a broomstick except powerful <b>Dark</b>  magic -- no kid could do that to
<br>a Nimbus Two Thousand."
<br>
<br>At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of
<br>looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.
<br>
<br>"What are you doing?" moaned Ron, gray-faced.
<br>
<br>"I knew it," Hermione gasped, "Snape -- look."
<br>
<br>Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands
<br>opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop
<br>under his breath.
<br>
<br>"He's doing something -- jinxing the broom," said Hermione.
<br>
<br>"What should we do?"
<br>
<br>"Leave it to me."
<br>
<br>Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned
<br>the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was
<br><b>almost</b>  impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on
<br>its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull
<br>Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good -- every time
<br>they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower
<br>and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell.
<br>Marcus
<br>
<br>Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.
<br>
<br>"Come on, Hermione," Ron muttered desperately.
<br>
<br>Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and
<br>was now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say
<br>sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front.
<br>Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a
<br>few, well- chosen words. Bright blue flames <b>shot</b>  from her wand onto the
<br>hem of Snape's robes.
<br>
<br>It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire.
<br>A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him
<br>into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row --
<br>Snape would never know what had happened.
<br>
<br>It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on
<br>to his broom.
<br>
<br>"Neville, you can look!" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into
<br>Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.
<br>
<br>Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his
<br>hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit the field
<br>on all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand.
<br>
<br>"I've got the Snitch!" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the
<br>game ended in complete confusion.
<br>
<br>"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it," Flint was still howling
<br>twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn't broken
<br>any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results --
<br>Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry
<br>heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back
<br>in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione.
<br>
<br>"It was Snape," Ron was explaining, "Hermione and I saw him. He was
<br>cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you."
<br>
<br>"Rubbish," said Hagrid, who hadn't heard a word of what had gone on next
<br>to him in the stands. "Why would Snape do somethin' like that?"
<br>
<br>Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell
<br>him. Harry decided on the truth.
<br>
<br>"I found out something about him," he told Hagrid. "He tried to get past
<br>that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying
<br>to <b>steal</b>  whatever it's guarding."
<br>
<br>Hagrid dropped the teapot.
<br>
<br>"How do you know about Fluffy?" he said.
<br>
<br>"Fluffy?"
<br>
<br>"Yeah -- he's mine -- bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub
<br>las' year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the
<br>
<br>"Yes?" said Harry eagerly.
<br>
<br>"Now, don't ask me anymore," said Hagrid gruffly. "That's top secret,
<br>that is."
<br>
<br>"But Snape's trying to <b>steal</b>  it."
<br>
<br>"Rubbish," said Hagrid again. "Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do
<br>nothin' of the sort."
<br>
<br>"So why did he just try and kill Harry?" cried Hermione.
<br>
<br>The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about
<br>Snape.
<br>
<br>I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them!
<br>
<br>You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw
<br>him!"
<br>
<br>"I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!" said Hagrid hotly. "I don' know why
<br>Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student!
<br>Now, listen to me, all three of yeh -- yer meddlin' in things that don'
<br>concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what
<br>it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel
<br>--"
<br>
<br>"Aha!" said Harry, "so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved,
<br>is there?"
<br>
<br>Hagrid looked furious with himself.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER TWELVE
<br>
<br>THE MIRROR OF ERISED
<br>
<br>Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find
<br>itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the
<br>Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that
<br>they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The
<br>few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to
<br>deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could
<br>fly off again.
<br>
<br>No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common
<br>room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had
<br>become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms.
<br>Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where
<br>their breath rose in a <b>mist</b>  before them and they kept as close as
<br>possible to their hot cauldrons.
<br>
<br>"I do feel so sorry," said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, "for all
<br>those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're
<br>not wanted at home."
<br>
<br>He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled.
<br>Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them.
<br>Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch
<br>match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get
<br>everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing
<br>Harry as Seeker next. Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny,
<br>because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay
<br>on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back
<br>to taunting Harry about having no proper family.
<br>
<br>It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas.
<br>Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of
<br>students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up
<br>at once. He didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be
<br>the best Christmas he'd ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying,
<br>too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit
<br>Charlie.
<br>
<br>When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large
<br>fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at
<br>the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.
<br>
<br>"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?" Ron asked, sticking his head through the
<br>branches.
<br>
<br>"Nah, I'm all right, thanks, Ron."
<br>
<br>"Would you mind moving out of the way?" came Malfoys cold drawl from
<br>behind them. "Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping
<br>to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose -- that hut
<br>of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used
<br>to."
<br>
<br>Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
<br>
<br>"WEASLEY!"
<br>
<br>Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes.
<br>
<br>"He was provoked, Professor Snape," said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy
<br>face out from behind the tree. "Malfoy was insultin' his family."
<br>
<br>"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid," said
<br>Snape silkily. "Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it
<br><b>isn</b> 't more. Move along, all of you."
<br>
<br>Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering
<br>needles everywhere and smirking.
<br>
<br>"I'll get him," said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, "one of
<br>these days, I'll get him --"
<br>
<br>"I hate them both," said Harry, "Malfoy and Snape."
<br>
<br>"Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas," said Hagrid. "Tell yeh what,
<br>come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat."
<br>
<br>So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to -the Great
<br>Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with
<br>the Christmas decorations.
<br>
<br>"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the far corner, would you?"
<br>
<br>The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all
<br>around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood
<br>around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with
<br>hundreds of candles.
<br>
<br>"How many days you got left until yer holidays?" Hagrid asked.
<br>
<br>"Just one," said Hermione. "And that reminds me -Harry, Ron, we've got
<br>half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library."
<br>
<br>"Oh yeah, you're right," said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor
<br>Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was
<br>trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
<br>
<br>"The library?" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. "Just before
<br>the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh?"
<br>
<br>"Oh, we're not working," Harry told him brightly. "Ever since you
<br>mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is."
<br>
<br>"You what?" Hagrid looked shocked. "Listen here -- I've told yeh -- drop
<br>it. It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'."
<br>
<br>"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all," said Hermione.
<br>
<br>"Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?" Harry added. "We
<br>must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him
<br>anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I've read his name somewhere."
<br>
<br>"I'm sayin' nothin, said Hagrid flatly.
<br>
<br>"Just have to find out for ourselves, then," said Ron, and they left
<br>Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
<br>
<br>They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid
<br>had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape
<br>was trying to <b>steal</b> ? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to
<br>begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a
<br>book. He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable
<br>Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern
<br>Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And
<br>then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of
<br>thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.
<br>
<br>Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to
<br>search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them
<br>off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted
<br>Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in
<br>there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the
<br>teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never
<br>get one. These were the books containing powerful <b>Dark</b>  Magic never
<br>taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced
<br>Defense <b>Against</b>  the <b>Dark</b>  Arts.
<br>
<br>"What are you looking for, boy?"
<br>
<br>"Nothing," said Harry.
<br>
<br>Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.
<br>
<br>"You'd better get out, then. Go on -- out!"
<br>
<br>Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left
<br>the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not
<br>ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be
<br>able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were
<br>up to.
<br>
<br>Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found
<br>anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two
<br>weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it
<br>wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a
<br>nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.
<br>
<br>Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.
<br>They went off to lunch.
<br>
<br>"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?" said Hermione. "And
<br>send me an owl if you find anything."
<br>
<br>"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is," said Ron.
<br>"It'd be safe to ask them."
<br>
<br>"Very safe, as they're both dentists," said Hermione.
<br>
<br>Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time
<br>to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the
<br>common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the
<br>good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they
<br>could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows
<br>-- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk
<br>about even if they wouldn't work.
<br>
<br>Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like
<br>Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot
<br>like directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered.
<br>Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in
<br>his family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen
<br>weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble
<br>getting them to do what he wanted.
<br>
<br>Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't
<br>trust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept
<br>shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. "Don't
<br>send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose
<br>him." On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next
<br>day for the food and the fun, but not <b>expecting</b>  any presents at all.
<br>When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a
<br>small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.
<br>
<br>"Merry Christmas," said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and
<br>pulled on his bathrobe.
<br>
<br>"You, too," said Harry. "Will you look at this? I've got some presents!"
<br>
<br>"What did you expect, turnips?" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which
<br>was a lot bigger than Harry's.
<br>
<br>Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and
<br>scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut
<br>wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it --
<br>it sounded a bit like an owl.
<br>
<br>A second, very small parcel contained a note.
<br>
<br>We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle
<br>Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a <b>fifty</b> -pence piece.
<br>
<br>"That's friendly," said Harry.
<br>
<br>Ron was fascinated by the <b>fifty</b>  pence.
<br>
<br>"Weird!" he said, 'NMat a shape! This is money?"
<br>
<br>"You can keep it," said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. "Hagrid
<br>and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?"
<br>
<br>"I think I know who that one's from," said Ron, turning a bit pink and
<br>pointing to a very lumpy parcel. "My mom. I told her you didn't expect
<br>any presents and -- oh, no," he groaned, "she's made you a Weasley
<br>sweater."
<br>
<br>Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in
<br>emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
<br>
<br>"Every year she makes us a sweater," said Ron, unwrapping his own, "and
<br>mine's always maroon."
<br>
<br>"That's really nice of her," said Harry, trying the fudge, which was
<br>very tasty.
<br>
<br>His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs
<br>from Hermione.
<br>
<br>This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very
<br>light. He unwrapped it.
<br>
<br>Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it
<br>lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.
<br>
<br>"I've heard of those," he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of
<br>Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione. "If that's what I think it
<br>is -- they're really rare, and really valuable."
<br>
<br>"What is it?"
<br>
<br>Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to
<br>the touch, like water woven into material.
<br>
<br>"It's an invisibility cloak," said Ron, a look of awe on his face. "I'm
<br>sure it is -- try it on."
<br>
<br>Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.
<br>
<br>"It is! Look down!"
<br>
<br>Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the
<br>mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head
<br>suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak
<br>over his head and his reflection vanished completely.
<br>
<br>"There's a note!" said Ron suddenly. "A note fell out of it!"
<br>
<br>Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow,
<br>loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your
<br>father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was
<br>returned to you. Use it well.
<br>
<br>A Very Merry Christmas to you.
<br>
<br>
<br>There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the
<br>cloak.
<br>
<br>"I'd give anything for one of these," he said. "Anything. What's the
<br>matter?"
<br>
<br>"Nothing," said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had
<br>it really once belonged to his father?
<br>
<br>Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung
<br>open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak
<br>quickly out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else
<br>yet.
<br>
<br>"Merry Christmas!"
<br>
<br>"Hey, look -- Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!"
<br>
<br>Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on
<br>it, the other a G.
<br>
<br>"Harry's is better than ours, though," said Fred, holding up Harry's
<br>sweater. "She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family."
<br>
<br>"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?" George demanded. "Come on, get it
<br>on, they're lovely and warm."
<br>
<br>"I hate maroon," Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.
<br>
<br>"You haven't got a letter on yours," George observed. "I suppose she
<br>thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid -- we know we're
<br>called Gred and Forge."
<br>
<br>"What's all th is noise.
<br>
<br>Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He
<br>had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too,
<br>carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which
<br>
<br>Fred seized.
<br>
<br>"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even
<br>Harry got one."
<br>
<br>"I -- don't -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater
<br>over his head, knocking his glasses askew.
<br>
<br>"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either," said
<br>
<br>George. "Christmas is a time for family."
<br>
<br>They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by
<br>his sweater.
<br>
<br>Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred
<br>fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of
<br>chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy
<br>and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet
<br>along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the
<br>feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little
<br>plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard
<br>cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like
<br>a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the
<br>inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at
<br>the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a
<br>flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick
<br>had just read him.
<br>
<br>Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his
<br>teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid
<br>getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine,
<br>finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's
<br>amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.
<br>
<br>When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of
<br>things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous
<br>balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set.
<br>The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were
<br>going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.
<br>
<br>Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball
<br>fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they
<br>returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in
<br>his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he
<br>wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.
<br>
<br>After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake,
<br>everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and
<br>watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because
<br>they'd stolen his prefect badge.
<br>
<br>It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been
<br>nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed
<br>was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had
<br>sent it.
<br>
<br>Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him,
<br>fell asleep <b>almost</b>  as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his
<br>four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the
<br>cloak out from under it.
<br>
<br>His father's... this had been his father's. He let the material flow
<br>over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note
<br>had said.
<br>
<br>He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak
<br>around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and
<br>shadows. It was a very funny feeling.
<br>
<br>Use it well.
<br>
<br>Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him
<br>in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the
<br>dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch
<br>would never know.
<br>
<br>Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back
<br>-- his father's cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he
<br>wanted to use it alone.
<br>
<br>He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room,
<br>and climbed through the portrait hole.
<br>
<br>"Who's there?" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked
<br>quickly down the corridor.
<br>
<br>Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then
<br>it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to
<br>read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was.
<br>He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he
<br>walked.
<br>
<br>The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his
<br>way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along
<br>in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the
<br>sight gave him the creeps.
<br>
<br>The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping
<br>carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the
<br>library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.
<br>
<br>They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled
<br>words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all.
<br>One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The
<br>hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it,
<br>maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books,
<br>as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.
<br>
<br>He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,
<br>he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large
<br>black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with
<br>difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee,
<br>let it fall open.
<br>
<br>A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was
<br>screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one
<br>high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over
<br>his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming
<br>down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the
<br>shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild
<br>eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's
<br>outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks
<br>still ringing in his ears.
<br>
<br>He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been
<br>so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where
<br>he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he
<br>was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he
<br>must be five floors above there.
<br>
<br>"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was
<br>wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted
<br>Section."
<br>
<br>Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must
<br>know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and
<br>to his horror, it was Snape who replied, "The Restricted Section? Well,
<br>they can't be far, we'll catch them."
<br>
<br>Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner
<br>ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor
<br>and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak
<br>didn't stop him from being solid.
<br>
<br>He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It
<br>was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying
<br>not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room
<br>without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry
<br>leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps
<br>dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before
<br>he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.
<br>
<br>It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs
<br>were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper
<br>basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that
<br>didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone
<br>had just put it there to keep it out of the way.
<br>
<br>It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold
<br>frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved
<br>around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic
<br>fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved
<br>nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection
<br>again. He stepped in front of it.
<br>
<br>He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He
<br>whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the
<br>book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but
<br>a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.
<br>
<br>But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to
<br>the mirror.
<br>
<br>There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,
<br>reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his
<br>shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible,
<br>too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's
<br>trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?
<br>
<br>He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his
<br>reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt
<br>the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their
<br>reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the
<br>others existed only in the mirror.
<br>
<br>She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her
<br>eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the
<br>glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that
<br>she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin,
<br>black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore
<br>glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as
<br>Harry's did.
<br>
<br>Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching
<br>that of his reflection.
<br>
<br>"Mom?" he whispered. "Dad?"
<br>
<br>They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the
<br>faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green
<br>eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as
<br>though he had Harry's knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family,
<br>for the first time in his life.
<br>
<br>The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at
<br>them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping
<br>to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache
<br>inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.
<br>
<br>How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade
<br>and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his
<br>senses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He
<br>tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, "I'll come back,"
<br>and hurried from the room.
<br>
<br>"You could have woken me up," said Ron, crossly.
<br>
<br>"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror.
<br>
<br>"I'd like to see your mom and dad," Ron said eagerly.
<br>
<br>"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to
<br>show me your other brothers and everyone."
<br>
<br>"You can see them any old time," said Ron. "Just come round my house
<br>this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not
<br>finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you
<br>eating anything?"
<br>
<br>Harry couldn't eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them
<br>again tonight. He had <b>almost</b>  forgotten about Flamel. It didn't seem very
<br>important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding?
<br>What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?
<br>
<br>"Are you all right?" said Ron. "You look odd."
<br>
<br>What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror
<br>room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much
<br>more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the
<br>library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.
<br>
<br>"I'm freezing," said Ron. "Let's forget it and go back."
<br>
<br>"No!" Harry hissed. I know it's here somewhere."
<br>
<br>They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction,
<br>but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead
<br>with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.
<br>
<br>"It's here -- just here -- yes!"
<br>
<br>They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his
<br>shoulders and ran to the mirror.
<br>
<br>There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.
<br>
<br>"See?" Harry whispered.
<br>
<br>"I can't see anything."
<br>
<br>"Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them...."
<br>
<br>"I can only see you."
<br>
<br>"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am."
<br>
<br>Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't
<br>see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.
<br>
<br>Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.
<br>
<br>"Look at me!" he said.
<br>
<br>"Can you see all your family standing around you?"
<br>
<br>"No -- I'm alone -- but I'm different -- I look older -- and I'm head
<br>boy!"
<br>
<br>"What?"
<br>
<br>"I am -- I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I'm holding the
<br>house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I'm Quidditch captain, too.
<br>
<br>Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at
<br>Harry.
<br>
<br>"Do you think this mirror shows the future?"
<br>
<br>"How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look --"
<br>
<br>"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time."
<br>
<br>"You're only holding the Quidditch cup, what's interesting about that? I
<br>want to see my parents."
<br>
<br>"Don't push me --"
<br>
<br>A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.
<br>They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking.
<br>
<br>"Quick!"
<br>
<br>Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris
<br>came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the
<br>same thing -- did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she
<br>turned and left.
<br>
<br>"This <b>isn</b> 't safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.
<br>Come on."
<br>
<br>And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
<br>
<br>The snow still hadn't melted the next morning.
<br>
<br>"Want to play chess, Harry?" said Ron.
<br>
<br>"No."
<br>
<br>"Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?"
<br>
<br>"No... you go..."
<br>
<br>"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don't go back
<br>tonight."
<br>
<br>"Why not?"
<br>
<br>"I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you've had
<br>too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are
<br>wandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into
<br>you? What if you knock something over?"
<br>
<br>"You sound like Hermione."
<br>
<br>"I'm serious, Harry, don't go."
<br>
<br>But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in
<br>front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.
<br>
<br>That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was
<br>walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he
<br>didn't meet anyone.
<br>
<br>And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of
<br>his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in
<br>front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all
<br>night with his family. Nothing at all.
<br>
<br>Except --
<br>
<br>"So -- back again, Harry?"
<br>
<br>Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind
<br>him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus
<br>Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to
<br>get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.
<br>
<br>" -- I didn't see you, sir."
<br>
<br>"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you," said Dumbledore,
<br>and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
<br>
<br>"So," said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with
<br>Harry, "you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of
<br>the Mirror of Erised."
<br>
<br>"I didn't know it was called that, Sir."
<br>
<br>"But I expect you've realized by now what it does?"
<br>
<br>"It -- well -- it shows me my family --"
<br>
<br>"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy."
<br>
<br>"How did you know --?"
<br>
<br>"I don't need a cloak to become invisible," said Dumbledore gently.
<br>"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?"
<br>
<br>Harry shook his head.
<br>
<br>"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the
<br>Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it
<br>and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?"
<br>
<br>Harry thought. Then he said slowly, "It shows us what we want...
<br>whatever we want..."
<br>
<br>"Yes and no," said Dumbledore quietly. "It shows us nothing more or less
<br>than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have
<br>never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley,
<br>who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing
<br>alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us
<br>neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by
<br>what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is
<br>real or even possible.
<br>
<br>"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you
<br>not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will
<br>now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live,
<br>remember that. Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and
<br>get off to bed?"
<br>
<br>Harry stood up.
<br>
<br>"Sir -- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?"
<br>
<br>"Obviously, you've just done so," Dumbledore smiled. "You may ask me one
<br>more thing, however."
<br>
<br>"What do you see when you look in the mirror?"
<br>
<br>"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks."
<br>
<br>Harry stared.
<br>
<br>"One can never have enough socks," said Dumbledore. "Another Christmas
<br>has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on
<br>giving me books."
<br>
<br>It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore
<br>might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved
<br>Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER THIRTEEN
<br>
<br>NICOLAS FLAMEL
<br>
<br>Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of
<br>Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the
<br>invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry
<br>wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he
<br>couldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed
<br>about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high
<br>voice cackled with laughter.
<br>
<br>"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad," said
<br>Ron, when Harry told him about these drearns.
<br>
<br>Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different
<br>view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being
<br>out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row ("If Filch had
<br>caught you!"), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who
<br>Nicolas Flamel was.
<br>
<br>They had <b>almost</b>  given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li- brary
<br>book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere.
<br>Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten
<br>minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other
<br>two, because Quidditch practice had started again.
<br>
<br>Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that
<br>had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys
<br>complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's
<br>side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would
<br>overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven
<br>years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer
<br>nightmares when he was tired out after training.
<br>
<br>Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave
<br>the team a bit of bad news. He'd just gotten very angry with the
<br>Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off
<br>their brooms.
<br>
<br>"Will you stop messing around!" he yelled. "That's exactly the sort of
<br>thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll
<br>be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!"
<br>
<br>George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.
<br>
<br>"Snape's refereeing?" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. "When's
<br>he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He's not going to be fair if we
<br>might overtake Slytherin."
<br>
<br>The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.
<br>
<br>"It's not my fault," said Wood. "We've just got to make sure we play a
<br>clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us."
<br>
<br>Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for
<br>not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....
<br>
<br>The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the
<br>end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common
<br>room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only
<br>thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very
<br>good for her.
<br>
<br>"Don't talk to me for a moment," said Ron when Harry sat down next to
<br>him, "I need to concen --" He caught sight of Harry's face. "What's the
<br>matter with you? You look terrible."
<br>
<br>Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other
<br>two about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.
<br>
<br>"Don't play," said Hermione at once.
<br>
<br>"Say you're ill," said Ron.
<br>
<br>"Pretend to break your leg," Hermione suggested.
<br>
<br>"Really break your leg," said Ron.
<br>
<br>"I can't," said Harry. "There <b>isn</b> 't a reserve Seeker. If I back out,
<br>Gryffindor can't play at all."
<br>
<br>At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed
<br>to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs
<br>had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the
<br>Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to
<br>Gryffindor tower.
<br>
<br>Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed
<br>the countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet,
<br>trembling. "What happened?" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit
<br>with Harry and Ron.
<br>
<br>"Malfoy," said Neville shakily. "I met him outside the library. He said
<br>he'd been looking for someone to practice that on."
<br>
<br>"Go to Professor McGonagall!" Hermione urged Neville. "Report him!"
<br>
<br>Neville shook his head.
<br>
<br>"I don't want more trouble," he mumbled.
<br>
<br>"You've got to stand up to him, Neville!" said Ron. "He's used to
<br>walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of
<br>him and make it easier."
<br>
<br>"There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor,
<br>Malfoy's already done that," Neville choked out.
<br>
<br>Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog,
<br>the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He
<br>gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.
<br>
<br>"You're worth twelve of Malfoy," Harry said. "The Sorting Hat chose you
<br>for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin."
<br>
<br>Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.
<br>
<br>"Thanks, Harry... I think I'll go to bed.... D'you want the card, you
<br>collect them, don't you?"
<br>
<br>As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.
<br>
<br>"Dumbledore again," he said, "He was the first one I ever-"
<br>
<br>He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron
<br>and Hermione.
<br>
<br>"I've found him!" he whispered. "I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read
<br>the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here -- listen
<br>to this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark
<br>wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of
<br>dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas
<br>Flamel'!"
<br>
<br>Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd
<br>gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.
<br>
<br>"Stay there!" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls'
<br>dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks
<br>before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.
<br>
<br>"I never thought to look in here!" she whispered excitedly. "I got this
<br>out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading."
<br>
<br>"Light?" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked
<br>something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages,
<br>muttering to herself.
<br>
<br>At last she found what she was looking for.
<br>
<br>"I knew it! I knew it!"
<br>
<br>"Are we allowed to speak yet?" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.
<br>
<br>"Nicolas Flamel," she whispered dramatically, "is the only known maker
<br>of the Sorcerer's Stone!"
<br>
<br>This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected.
<br>
<br>"The what?" said Harry and Ron.
<br>
<br>"Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look -- read that, there."
<br>
<br>She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient
<br>study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a
<br>legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform
<br>any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which
<br>will make the drinker immortal.
<br>
<br>There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries,
<br>but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel,
<br>the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six
<br>hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon
<br>with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and <b>fifty</b> -eight).
<br>
<br>"See?" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. "The dog must be
<br>guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it
<br>safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it,
<br>that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!"
<br>
<br>"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!" said Harry. "No
<br>wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it."
<br>
<br>"And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent
<br>Developments in Wizardry," said Ron. "He's not exactly recent if he's
<br>six hundred and sixty-five, is he?"
<br>
<br>The next morning in Defense <b>Against</b>  the <b>Dark</b>  Arts, while copying down
<br>different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still
<br>discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one. It
<br>wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry
<br>remembered about Snape and the coming match.
<br>
<br>"I'm going to play," he told Ron and Hermione. "If I don't, all the
<br>Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape. I'll show
<br>them... it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win."
<br>
<br>"Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field," said Hermione.
<br>
<br>As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous,
<br>whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn't too calm,
<br>either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was
<br>wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed
<br>to, with such a biased referee?
<br>
<br>Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to
<br>keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered
<br>whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions
<br>lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so
<br>horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the
<br>Sorcerer's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had
<br>the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.
<br>
<br>Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the
<br>next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever
<br>see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry
<br>hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch
<br>robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.
<br>
<br>Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to
<br>Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or
<br>why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry
<br>know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker
<br>Curse. They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were
<br>ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.
<br>
<br>"Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis," Hermione muttered as Ron
<br>slipped his wand up his sleeve.
<br>
<br>"I know," Ron snapped. "Don't nag."
<br>
<br>Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.
<br>
<br>"Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early
<br>capture of the Snitch it's now. Finish the game before Snape can favor
<br>Hufflepuff too much."
<br>
<br>"The whole school's out there!" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the
<br>door. "Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore's come to watch!"
<br>
<br>Harry's heart did a somersault.
<br>
<br>"Dumbledore?" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right.
<br>There was no mistaking that silver beard.
<br>
<br>Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was
<br>simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was
<br>watching.
<br>
<br>Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched
<br>onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.
<br>
<br>"I've never seen Snape look so mean," he told Hermione. "Look -they're
<br>off Ouch!"
<br>
<br>Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.
<br>
<br>"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there."
<br>
<br>Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.
<br>
<br>"Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone
<br>want a bet? What about you, Weasley?"
<br>
<br>Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because
<br>George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her
<br>fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was
<br>circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.
<br>
<br>"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?" said
<br>Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another
<br>penalty for no reason at all. "It's people they feel sorry for. See,
<br>there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've
<br>got no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no
<br>brains."
<br>
<br>Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.
<br>
<br>"I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy," he stammered.
<br>
<br>Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not
<br>daring to take his eyes from the game, said, "You tell him, Neville."
<br>
<br>"Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and
<br>that's saying something."
<br>
<br>Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety
<br>about Harry.
<br>
<br>"I'm warning you, Malfoy -- one more word
<br>
<br>"Ron!" said Hermione suddenly, "Harry --"
<br>
<br>"What? Where?"
<br>
<br>Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and
<br>cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her
<br>mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
<br>
<br>"You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the
<br>ground!" said Malfoy.
<br>
<br>Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of
<br>him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over
<br>the back of his seat to help.
<br>
<br>"Come on, Harry!" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as
<br>Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron
<br>rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the
<br>whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
<br>
<br>Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see
<br>something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next
<br>second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the
<br>Snitch clasped in his hand.
<br>
<br>The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember
<br>the Snitch being caught so quickly.
<br>
<br>"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won! We've won!
<br>Gryffindor is in the lead!" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on
<br>her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.
<br>
<br>Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn't believe
<br>it. He'd done it -- the game was over; it had barely lasted five
<br>minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land
<br>nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his
<br>shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face.
<br>
<br>"Well done," said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear.
<br>"Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror... been keeping
<br>busy... excellent..."
<br>
<br>Snape spat bitterly on the ground.
<br>
<br>Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two
<br>Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling
<br>happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now -- no one could
<br>say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never
<br>smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour
<br>in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him
<br>onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and
<br>down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
<br>
<br>Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked
<br>up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.
<br>Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape....
<br>
<br>And speaking of Snape...
<br>
<br>A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly
<br>not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the
<br>forbidden forest. Harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched. He
<br>recognized the figure's prowling walk. Snape, <b>sneaking</b>  into the forest
<br>while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on?
<br>
<br>Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding
<br>silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He
<br>followed.
<br>
<br>The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone. He flew in
<br>circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he
<br>heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering
<br>beech tree.
<br>
<br>He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his
<br>broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy
<br>clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell was there, too.
<br>Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering
<br>worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.
<br>
<br>"... d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places,
<br>Severus..."
<br>
<br>"Oh, I thought we'd keep this private," said Snape, his voice icy.
<br>"Students aren't supposed to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after
<br>all."
<br>
<br>Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted
<br>him.
<br>
<br>"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?"
<br>
<br>"B-b-but Severus, I --"
<br>
<br>"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell," said Snape, taking a step
<br>toward him.
<br>
<br>"I-I don't know what you
<br>
<br>"You know perfectly well what I mean."
<br>
<br>An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied
<br>himself in time to hear Snape say, "-- your little bit of hocus-pocus.
<br>I'm waiting."
<br>
<br>"B-but I d-d-don't --"
<br>
<br>"Very well," Snape cut in. "We'll have another little chat soon, when
<br>you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties
<br>lie."
<br>
<br>He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was
<br><b>almost</b>  dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as
<br>though he was petrified.
<br>
<br>"Harry, where have you been?" Hermione squeaked.
<br>
<br>"We won! You won! We won!" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. "And
<br>I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle
<br>single-handed! He's still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he'll be all
<br>right - talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone's waiting for you in the
<br>common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and
<br>stuff from the kitchens."
<br>
<br>"Never mind that now," said Harry breathlessly. "Let's find an empty
<br>room, you wait 'til you hear this...."
<br>
<br>He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them,
<br>then he told them what he'd seen and heard.
<br>
<br>"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone, and Snape's trying to
<br>force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past
<br>Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell's 'hocus pocuss-- I reckon
<br>there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of
<br>enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-<b>Dark</b>  Arts
<br><b>spell</b>  that Snape needs to break through --"
<br>
<br>"So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to
<br>Snape?" said Hermione in alarm.
<br>
<br>"It'll be gone by next Tuesday," said Ron.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER FOURTEEN
<br>
<br>NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK
<br>
<br>Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought. In the
<br>weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it
<br>didn't look as though he'd cracked yet.
<br>
<br>Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and
<br>Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was
<br>still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper,
<br>which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed
<br>Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron
<br>had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter.
<br>
<br>Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone. She
<br>had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes.
<br>Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the
<br>same.
<br>
<br>"Hermione, the exams are ages away."
<br>
<br>"Ten weeks," Hermione snapped. "That's not ages, that's like a second to
<br>Nicolas Flamel."
<br>
<br>"But we're not six hundred years old," Ron reminded her. "Anyway, what
<br>are you studying for, you already know it A."
<br>
<br>"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass
<br>these exams to get into the second year? They're very important, I
<br>should have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten
<br>into me...."
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines
<br>as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter
<br>holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard
<br>to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's
<br>blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron
<br>spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get
<br>through all their extra work.
<br>
<br>"I'll never remember this," Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down
<br>his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the
<br>first really fine day they'd had in months. The sky was a clear,
<br>forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.
<br>
<br>Harry, who was looking up "Dittany" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and
<br>Fungi, didn't look up until he heard Ron say, "Hagrid! What are you
<br>doing in the library?"
<br>
<br>Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked
<br>very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.
<br>
<br>"Jus' lookin'," he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at
<br>once. "An' what're you lot up ter?" He looked suddenly suspicious. "Yer
<br>not still lookin' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?" "Oh, we found out who he
<br>is ages ago," said Ron impressively. "And we know what that dog's
<br>guarding, it's a Sorcerer's St --"
<br>
<br>"Shhhh!" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.
<br>"Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?"
<br>
<br>"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact," said
<br>Harry, "about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy --"
<br>
<br>"SHHHH!" said Hagrid again. "Listen - come an' see me later, I'm not
<br>promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it
<br>in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know. They'll think I've told yeh
<br>--"
<br>
<br>"See you later, then," said Harry.
<br>
<br>Hagrid shuffled off.
<br>
<br>"What was he hiding behind his back?" said Hermione thoughtfully.
<br>
<br>"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?"
<br>
<br>"I'm going to see what section he was in," said Ron, who'd had enough of
<br>working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms
<br>and slammed them down on the table.
<br>
<br>"Dragons!" he whispered. "Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!
<br>Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to
<br>Inferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide."
<br>
<br>"Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever
<br>met him, " said Harry.
<br>
<br>"But it's against our laws," said Ron. "Dragon breeding was outlawed by
<br>the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard to stop
<br>Muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden -
<br>anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous. You should see the burns
<br>Charlie's got off wild ones in Romania."
<br>
<br>"But there aren't wild dragons in Britain?" said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Of course there are," said Ron. "<b>Common</b>  Welsh Green and Hebridean
<br>Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you.
<br>Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to
<br>make them forget."
<br>
<br>"So what on earths Hagrid up to?" said Hermione.
<br>
<br>When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later,
<br>they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid
<br>called "Who is it?" before he let them in, and then shut the door
<br>quickly behind them.
<br>
<br>It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there
<br>was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them
<br>stoat sandwiches, which they refused.
<br>
<br>"So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?"
<br>
<br>"Yes," said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. "We were
<br>wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone
<br>apart from Fluffy."
<br>
<br>Hagrid frowned at him.
<br>
<br>"0' course I cant, he said. "Number one, I don' know meself. Number two,
<br>yeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could. That
<br>Stone's here fer a good reason. It Was <b>almost</b>  stolen outta Gringotts - I
<br>s'ppose yeh've worked that out an' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou'
<br>Fluffy."
<br>
<br>"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know,
<br>you know everything that goes on round here," said Hermione in a warm,
<br>flattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was
<br>smiling. "We only wondered who had done the guarding, really." Hermione
<br>went on. "We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him,
<br>apart from you."
<br>
<br>Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at
<br>Hermione.
<br>
<br>"Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let's see... he
<br>borrowed Fluffy from me... then some o' the teachers did enchantments...
<br>Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall --" he
<br>ticked them off on his fingers, "Professor Quirrell -- an' Dumbledore
<br>himself did somethin', o' course. Hang on, I've forgotten someone. Oh
<br>yeah, Professor Snape."
<br>
<br>"Snape?"
<br>
<br>"Yeah -- yer not still on abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped
<br>protect the Stone, he's not about ter <b>steal</b>  it."
<br>
<br>Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape
<br>had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out
<br>how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything --
<br>except, it seemed, Quirrell's <b>spell</b>  and how to get past Fluffy.
<br>
<br>"You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren't you,
<br>Hagrid?" said Harry anxiously. "And you wouldn't tell anyone, would you?
<br>Not even one of the teachers?"
<br>
<br>"Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore," said Hagrid proudly.
<br>
<br>"Well, that's something," Harry muttered to the others. "Hagrid, can we
<br>have a window open? I'm boiling."
<br>
<br>"Can't, Harry, sorry," said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the
<br>fire. Harry looked at it, too.
<br>
<br>"Hagrid -- what's that?"
<br>
<br>But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire,
<br>underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.
<br>
<br>"Ah," said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, "That's er..."
<br>
<br>"Where did you get it, Hagrid?" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get
<br>a closer look at the egg. "It must've cost you a fortune."
<br>
<br>"Won it," said Hagrid. "Las' night. I was down in the village havin' a
<br>few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. Think he was
<br>quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest."
<br>
<br>"But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?" said Hermione.
<br>
<br>"Well, I've bin doin' some readin' , said Hagrid, pulling a large book
<br>from under his pillow. "Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breeding
<br>for Pleasure and Profit -- it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's
<br>all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on I
<br>em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with
<br>chicken blood every half hour. An' see here -- how ter recognize
<br>diff'rent eggs -- what I got there's a Norwegian Ridgeback. They're
<br>rare, them."
<br>
<br>He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't.
<br>
<br>"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house," she said.
<br>
<br>But Hagrid wasn't listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the
<br>fire.
<br>
<br>So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to
<br>Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.
<br>"Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life," Ron sighed, as evening
<br>after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were
<br>getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and
<br>Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.
<br>
<br>Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid.
<br>He had written only two words: It's hatching.
<br>
<br>Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione
<br>wouldn't hear of it.
<br>
<br>"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon
<br>hatching?"
<br>
<br>"We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what
<br>Hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing --"
<br>
<br>"Shut up!" Harry whispered.
<br>
<br>Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How
<br>much had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all.
<br>
<br>Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,
<br>Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during
<br>morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their
<br>lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried
<br>through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them,
<br>looking flushed and excited.
<br>
<br>"It's nearly out." He ushered them inside.
<br>
<br>The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something
<br>was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.
<br>
<br>They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated
<br>breath.
<br>
<br>All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby
<br>dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought
<br>it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge
<br>compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils,
<br>the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.
<br>
<br>It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.
<br>
<br>"Isn't he beautiful?" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke
<br>the dragon's head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.
<br>
<br>"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!" said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>"Hagrid," said Hermione, "how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow,
<br>exactly?"
<br>
<br>Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face
<br>-- he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.
<br>
<br>"What's the matter?"
<br>
<br>"Someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains -- it's a kid --
<br>he's runnin' back up ter the school."
<br>
<br>Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no
<br>mistaking him.
<br>
<br>Malfoy had seen the dragon.
<br>
<br>Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week
<br>made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their
<br>free time in Hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with him.
<br>
<br>"Just let him go," Harry urged. "Set him free."
<br>
<br>"I can't," said Hagrid. "He's too little. He'd die."
<br>
<br>They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a
<br>week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn't been doing
<br>his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There
<br>were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.
<br>
<br>"I've decided to call him Norbert," said Hagrid, looking at the dragon
<br>with misty eyes. "He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert!
<br>Where's Mommy?"
<br>
<br>"He's lost his marbles," Ron muttered in Harry's ear.
<br>
<br>"Hagrid," said Harry loudly, "give it two weeks and Norbert's going to
<br>be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment."
<br>
<br>Hagrid bit his lip.
<br>
<br>"I -- I know I can't keep him forever, but I can't jus' dump him, I
<br>can't."
<br>
<br>Harry suddenly turned to Ron. Charlie, he said.
<br>
<br>"You're losing it, too," said Ron. "I'm Ron, remember?"
<br>
<br>"No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons.
<br>We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put
<br>him back in the wild!"
<br>
<br>"Brilliant!" said Ron. "How about it, Hagrid?"
<br>
<br>And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send -an owl to Charlie to
<br>ask him.
<br>
<br>The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry
<br>sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to
<br>bed. The clock on the wall had just
<br>
<br>chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of
<br>nowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak. He had been down at
<br>Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by
<br>the crate.
<br>
<br>"It bit me!" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a
<br>bloody <b>handkerchief</b> . "I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a
<br>week. I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met,
<br>but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little
<br>bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when
<br>I left, he was singing it a lullaby."
<br>
<br>There was a tap on the dark window.
<br>
<br>"It's Hedwig!" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. "She'll have
<br>Charlie's answer!"
<br>
<br>The three of them put their heads together to read the note.
<br>
<br>Dear Ron,
<br>
<br>How are you? Thanks for the letter -- I'd be glad to take the Norwegian
<br>Ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here. I think the best thing
<br>will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to
<br>visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal
<br>dragon.
<br>
<br>Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on
<br>Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it's still
<br>dark.
<br>
<br>Send me an answer as soon as possible.
<br>
<br>Love,
<br>
<br>Charlie
<br>
<br>They looked at one another.
<br>
<br>"We've got the invisibility cloak," said Harry. "It shouldn't be too
<br>difficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and
<br>Norbert."
<br>
<br>It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two
<br>agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy.
<br>
<br>There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to
<br>twice its usual size. He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam
<br>Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though,
<br>he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked
<br>as if Norbert's fangs were poisonous.
<br>
<br>Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day
<br>to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.
<br>
<br>"It's not just my hand," he whispered, "although that feels like it's
<br>about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of
<br>my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept
<br>threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I've told her it was a
<br>dog, but I don't think she believes me -I shouldn't have hit him at the
<br>Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this."
<br>
<br>Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
<br>
<br>"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday," said Hermione, but this
<br>didn't soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke
<br>into a sweat.
<br>
<br>"Midnight on Saturday!" he said in a hoarse voice. "Oh no oh no -- I've
<br>just remembered -- Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's
<br>going to know we're getting rid of Norbert."
<br>
<br>Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came
<br>over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.
<br>
<br>"It's too late to change the plan now," Harry told Hermione. "We haven't
<br>got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance
<br>to get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it. And we have got the
<br>invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that."
<br>
<br>They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail
<br>when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.
<br>
<br>"I won't let you in," he puffed. "Norbert's at a <b>tricky</b>  stage -- nothin'
<br>I can't handle."
<br>
<br>When they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears,
<br>although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the
<br>leg.
<br>
<br>"Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot -- jus' playin' -- he's only
<br>a baby, after all."
<br>
<br>The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry
<br>and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come
<br>quickly enough.
<br>
<br>They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say
<br>good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had
<br>to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late
<br>arriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get
<br>out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis
<br>against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.
<br>
<br>"He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer the journey," said Hagrid in
<br>a muffled voice. "An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets
<br>lonely."
<br>
<br>From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as
<br>though the teddy was having his head torn off.
<br>
<br>"Bye-bye, Norbert!" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the
<br>crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves.
<br>"Mommy will never forget you!"
<br>
<br>How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never
<br>knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble
<br>staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another
<br>staircase, then another -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the
<br>work much easier.
<br>
<br>"Nearly there!" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the
<br>tallest tower.
<br>
<br>Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them <b>almost</b>  drop the crate.
<br>Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the
<br>shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each
<br>other ten feet away. A lamp flared.
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by
<br>the ear.
<br>
<br>"Detention!" she shouted. "And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering
<br>around in the middle of the night, how dare you --"
<br>
<br>"You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming -- he's got a
<br>dragon!"
<br>
<br>"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall see
<br>Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!"
<br>
<br>The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest
<br>thing in the world after that. Not until they'd stepped out into the
<br>cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe
<br>properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.
<br>
<br>"Malfoy's got detention! I could sing!"
<br>
<br>"Don't," Harry advised her.
<br>
<br>Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his
<br>crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out
<br>of the darkness.
<br>
<br>Charlie's friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the
<br>harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.
<br>They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and
<br>Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.
<br>
<br>At last, Norbert was going... going... gone.
<br>
<br>They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as
<br>their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy in
<br>detention -- what could spoil their happiness?
<br>
<br>The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they
<br>stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the
<br>darkness.
<br>
<br>"Well, well, well," he whispered, "we are in trouble."
<br>
<br>They'd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER FIFTEEN
<br>
<br>THE FORIBIDDEN FOREST
<br>
<br>Things couldn't have been worse.
<br>
<br>Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor,
<br>where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione
<br>was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each
<br>other around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn't
<br>see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were
<br>cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak?
<br>There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for
<br>their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of
<br>night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was
<br>out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility
<br>cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.
<br>
<br>Had Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong.
<br>When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.
<br>
<br>"Harry!" Neville burst Out, the moment he saw the other two. "I was
<br>trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to
<br>catch you, he said you had a drag --"
<br>
<br>Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor
<br>McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert
<br>as she towered over the three of them.
<br>
<br>"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were
<br>up in the astronomy tower. It's one o'clock in the morning. Explain
<br>yourselves."
<br>
<br>It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's
<br>question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.
<br>
<br>"I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on," said Professor
<br>McGonagall. "It doesn't take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco
<br>Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of
<br>bed and into trouble. I've already caught him. I suppose you think it's
<br>funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?"
<br>
<br>Harry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this
<br>wasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor,
<br>blundering Neville -- Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and
<br>find them in the dark, to warn them.
<br>
<br>"I'm disgusted," said Professor McGonagall. "Four students out of bed in
<br>one night! I've never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I
<br>thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor
<br>meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions --
<br>yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around
<br>school at night, especially these days, it's very dangerous -- and <b>fifty</b> 
<br>points will be taken from Gryffindor."
<br>
<br>"Fifty?" Harry gasped -- they would lose the lead, the lead he'd won in
<br>the last Quidditch match.
<br>
<br>"Fifty points each," said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily
<br>through her long, pointed nose.
<br>
<br>"Professor -- please
<br>
<br>"You can't --"
<br>
<br>"Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all
<br>of you. I've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students."
<br>
<br>A hundred and <b>fifty</b>  points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In
<br>one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house
<br>cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How
<br>could they ever make up for this?
<br>
<br>Harry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his
<br>pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn't think of anything to
<br>say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the
<br>dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what
<br>they'd done?
<br>
<br>At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the
<br>house points the next day thought there'd been a mistake. How could they
<br>suddenly have a hundred and <b>fifty</b>  points fewer than yesterday? And then
<br>the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter,
<br>their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lo st them all those points,
<br>him and a couple of other stupid first years.
<br>
<br>From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school,
<br>Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs
<br>turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose
<br>the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble
<br>to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other
<br>hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, "Thanks
<br>Potter, we owe you one!"
<br>
<br>Only Ron stood by him.
<br>
<br>"They'll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads
<br>of points in all the time they've been here, and people still like
<br>them."
<br>
<br>"They've never lost a hundred and <b>fifty</b>  points in one go, though, have
<br>they?" said Harry miserably.
<br>
<br>"Well -- no," Ron admitted.
<br>
<br>It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not
<br>to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on. He'd had it
<br>with <b>sneaking</b>  around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he
<br>went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.
<br>
<br>"Resign?" Wood thundered. "What good'll that do? How are we going to get
<br>any points back if we can't win at Quidditch?"
<br>
<br>But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn't speak
<br>to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they
<br>called him "the Seeker."
<br>
<br>Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn't have as bad a time
<br>as Harry, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to
<br>them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in
<br>class, keeping her head down and working in silence.
<br>
<br>Harry was <b>almost</b>  glad that the exams weren't far away. All the studying
<br>he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to
<br>themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the
<br>ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart,
<br>memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions....
<br>
<br>Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new
<br>resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put
<br>to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one
<br>afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he
<br>drew closer, he heard Quirrell's voice.
<br>
<br>"No -- no -- not again, please --"
<br>
<br>It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.
<br>
<br>"All right -- all right --" he heard Quirrell sob.
<br>
<br>Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening
<br>his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He
<br>strode out of sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him.
<br>He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into
<br>the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end.
<br>Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised
<br>himself about not meddling.
<br>
<br>All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had
<br>just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be
<br>walking with a new spring in his step -- Quirrell seemed to have given
<br>in at last.
<br>
<br>Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on
<br>Astronomy. Harry told them what he'd heard.
<br>
<br>"Snape's done it, then!" said Ron. "If Quirrell's told him how to break
<br>his Anti-<b>Dark</b>  Force <b>spell</b>  --"
<br>
<br>"There's still Fluffy, though," said Hermione.
<br>
<br>"Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,"
<br>said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. "I bet
<br>there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant
<br>three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?"
<br>
<br>The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione
<br>answered before Harry could.
<br>
<br>"Go to Dumbledore. That's what we should have done ages ago. If we try
<br>anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure."
<br>
<br>"But we've got no proof!" said Harry. "Quirrell's too scared to back us
<br>up. Snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at
<br>Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you
<br>think they'll believe, him or us? It's not exactly a secret we hate him,
<br>Dumbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn't help
<br>us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with Snape, and the
<br>more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think. And don't forget,
<br>we're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That'll take a lot
<br>of explaining."
<br>
<br>Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't.
<br>
<br>"If we just do a bit of poking around --"
<br>
<br>"No," said Harry flatly, "we've done enough poking around."
<br>
<br>He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of
<br>its moons.
<br>
<br>The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and
<br>Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:
<br>
<br>Your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight. Meet Mr. Filch
<br>in the entrance hall.
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do
<br>in the furor over the points they'd lost. He half expected Hermione to
<br>complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't
<br>say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they'd got.
<br>
<br>At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common
<br>room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already
<br>there -- and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had
<br>gotten a detention, too.
<br>
<br>"Follow me," said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.
<br>
<br>I bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you,
<br>eh?" he said, leering at them. "Oh yes... hard work and pain are the
<br>best teachers if you ask me.... It's just a pity they let the old
<br>punishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a
<br>few days, I've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in
<br>case they're ever needed.... Right, off we go, and don't think of
<br>running off, now, it'll be worse for you if you do."
<br>
<br>They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry
<br>wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something
<br>really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted.
<br>
<br>The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them
<br>into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's
<br>hut. Then they heard a distant shout.
<br>
<br>"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started."
<br>
<br>Harry's heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it
<br>wouldn't be so bad. His relief must have showed in his -face, because
<br>Filch said, "I suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself with that
<br>oaf? Well, think again, boy -- it's into the forest you're going and I'm
<br>much mistaken if you'll all come out in one piece."
<br>
<br>At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his
<br>tracks.
<br>
<br>"The forest?" he repeated, and he didn't sound quite as cool as usual.
<br>"We can't go in there at night -- there's all sorts of things in there
<br>-- werewolves, I heard."
<br>
<br>Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry's robe and made a choking noise.
<br>
<br>"That's your problem, <b>isn</b> 't it?" said Filch, his voice cracking with
<br>glee. "Should've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble,
<br>shouldn't you?"
<br>
<br>Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He
<br>was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his
<br>shoulder.
<br>
<br>"Abou' time," he said. "I bin waitin' fer half an hour already. All
<br>right, Harry, Hermione?"
<br>
<br>"I shouldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid," said Filch coldly,
<br>they're here to be punished, after all."
<br>
<br>"That's why yer late, is it?" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. "Bin
<br>lecturin' them, eh? 'Snot your place ter do that. Yeh've done yer bit,
<br>I'll take over from here."
<br>
<br>"I'll be back at dawn," said Filch, "for what's left of them," he added
<br>nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp
<br>bobbing away in the darkness.
<br>
<br>Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.
<br>
<br>"I'm not going in that forest, he said, and Harry was pleased to hear
<br>the note of panic in his voice.
<br>
<br>"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts," said Hagrid fiercely.
<br>"Yeh've done wrong an' now yehve got ter pay fer it."
<br>
<br>"But this is servant stuff, it's not for students to do. I thought we'd
<br>be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he'd
<br>
<br>tell yer that's how it is at Hogwarts," Hagrid growled. "Copyin' lines!
<br>What good's that ter anyone? Yeh'll do summat useful or Yeh'll get out.
<br>If yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off
<br>ter the castle an' pack. Go on"'
<br>
<br>Malfoy didn't move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his
<br>gaze.
<br>
<br>"Right then," said Hagrid, "now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous
<br>what we're gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no one takin' risks. Follow
<br>me over here a moment."
<br>
<br>He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he
<br>pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the
<br>thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into
<br>the forest.
<br>
<br>"Look there," said Hagrid, "see that stuff shinin' on the ground?
<br>Silvery stuff? That's unicorn blood. There's a unicorn in there bin hurt
<br>badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead
<br>last Wednesday. We're gonna try an' find the <b>poor</b>  thing. We might have
<br>ter put it out of its misery."
<br>
<br>"And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?" said Malfoy,
<br>unable to keep the fear out of his voice.
<br>
<br>"There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with
<br>me or Fang," said Hagrid. "An' keep ter the path. Right, now, we're
<br>gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent
<br>directions. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin'
<br>around since last night at least."
<br>
<br>"I want Fang," said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang's long teeth.
<br>
<br>"All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward," said Hagrid. " So me, Harry,
<br>an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville, an' Fang'll go the other.
<br>Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right?
<br>Get yer wands out an' practice now -- that's it -- an' if anyone gets in
<br>trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh -- so, be
<br>careful -- let's go."
<br>
<br>The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a
<br>fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left
<br>path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.
<br>
<br>They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a
<br>ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue
<br>blood on the fallen leaves.
<br>
<br>Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.
<br>
<br>"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?" Harry asked.
<br>
<br>"Not fast enough," said Hagrid. "It's not easy ter catch a unicorn,
<br>they're powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before."
<br>
<br>They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water;
<br>there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of
<br>unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.
<br>
<br>"You all right, Hermione?" Hagrid whispered. "Don' worry, it can't've
<br>gone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll be able ter -- GET
<br>BEHIND THAT TREE!"
<br>
<br>Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a
<br>towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow,
<br>raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was
<br>slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing
<br>along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few
<br>seconds, the sound faded away.
<br>
<br>"I knew it, " he murmured. "There's summat in here that shouldn' be."
<br>
<br>"A werewolf?" Harry suggested.
<br>
<br>"That wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither," said Hagrid
<br>grimly. "Right, follow me, but careful, now."
<br>
<br>They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound.
<br>Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.
<br>
<br>"Who's there?" Hagrid called. "Show yerself -- I'm armed!"
<br>
<br>And into the clearing came -- was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a
<br>man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming
<br>chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione's jaws
<br>dropped.
<br>
<br>"Oh, it's you, Ronan," said Hagrid in relief. "How are yeh?"
<br>
<br>He walked forward and shook the centaur's hand.
<br>
<br>"Good evening to you, Hagrid," said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful
<br>voice. "Were you going to shoot me?"
<br>
<br>"Can't be too careful, Ronan," said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.
<br>"There's summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an'
<br>Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An' this is
<br>Ronan, you two. He's a centaur.))
<br>
<br>"We'd noticed," said Hermione faintly.
<br>
<br>"Good evening," said Ronan. "Students, are you? And do you learn much,
<br>up at the school?"
<br>
<br>"Erm --"
<br>
<br>"A bit," said Hermione timidly.
<br>
<br>"A bit. Well, that's something." Ronan sighed. He flung back his head
<br>and stared at the sky. "Mars is bright tonight."
<br>
<br>"Yeah," said Hagrid, glancing up, too. "Listen, I'm glad we've run inter
<br>yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin'?"
<br>
<br>Ronan didn't answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then
<br>sighed again.
<br>
<br>"Always the innocent are the first victims," he said. "So it has been
<br>for ages past, so it is now."
<br>
<br>"Yeah," said Hagrid, "but have yeh seen anythin', Ronan? Anythin'
<br>unusual?"
<br>
<br>"Mars is bright tonight," Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him
<br>impatiently. "Unusually bright."
<br>
<br>"Yeah, but I was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home, said
<br>Hagrid. "So yeh haven't noticed anythin' strange?"
<br>
<br>Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, "The forest
<br>hides many secrets."
<br>
<br>A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again,
<br>but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and
<br>wilder-looking than Ronan.
<br>
<br>"Hullo, Bane," said Hagrid. "All right?"
<br>
<br>"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?"
<br>
<br>"Well enough. Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, you seen anythin' odd in
<br>here lately? There's a unicorn bin injured -- would yeh know anythin'
<br>about it?"
<br>
<br>Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. "Mars is
<br>bright tonight," he said simply.
<br>
<br>"We've heard," said Hagrid grumpily. "Well, if either of you do see
<br>anythin', let me know, won't yeh? We'll be off, then."
<br>
<br>Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their
<br>shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.
<br>
<br>"Never," said Hagrid irritably, "try an' get a straight answer out of a
<br>centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin' closer'n the
<br>moon."
<br>
<br>"Are there many of them in here?" asked Hermione.
<br>
<br>"Oh, a fair few... Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're
<br>good enough about turnin' up if ever I want a word. They're deep, mind,
<br>centaurs... they know things... jus' don' let on much."
<br>
<br>"D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?" said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's
<br>bin killin' the unicorns -- never heard anythin' like it before."
<br>
<br>They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking
<br>nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being
<br>watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them.
<br>They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's
<br>arm.
<br>
<br>"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!"
<br>
<br>"You two wait here!" Hagrid shouted. "Stay on the path, I'll come back
<br>for yeh!"
<br>
<br>They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking
<br>at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the
<br>rustling of leaves around them.
<br>
<br>"You don't think they've been hurt, do you?" whispered Hermione.
<br>
<br>"I don't care if Malfoy has, but if something's got Neville... it's our
<br>fault he's here in the first place."
<br>
<br>The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry's
<br>seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.
<br>What was going on? Where were the others?
<br>
<br>At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy,
<br>Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed,
<br>had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had
<br>panicked and sent up the sparks.
<br>
<br>"We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were
<br>makin'. Right, we're changin' groups -- Neville, you stay with me an'
<br>Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot. I'm sorry," Hagrid
<br>added in a <b>whisper</b>  to Harry, "but he'll have a harder time frightenin'
<br>you, an' we've gotta get this done."
<br>
<br>So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They
<br>walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until
<br>the path became <b>almost</b>  impossible to follow because the trees were so
<br>thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were
<br>splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the <b>poor</b>  creature had been
<br>thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead,
<br>through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.
<br>
<br>"Look --" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.
<br>
<br>Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.
<br>
<br>It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen
<br>anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at
<br>odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on
<br>the dark leaves.
<br>
<br>Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him
<br>freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered....
<br>Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the
<br>ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood
<br>transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head
<br>over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood.
<br>
<br>"AAAAAAAAAARGH!"
<br>
<br>Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang. The hooded
<br>figure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was
<br>dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward
<br>Harry -- he couldn't move for fear.
<br>
<br>Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as
<br>though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He
<br>heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over
<br>Harry, charging at the figure.
<br>
<br>The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a
<br>minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur
<br>was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he
<br>had white-blond hair and a palomino body.
<br>
<br>"Are you all right?" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.
<br>
<br>"Yes -- thank you -- what was that?"
<br>
<br>The centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale
<br>sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar
<br>that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead.
<br>
<br>"You are the Potter boy," he said. "You had better get back to Hagrid.
<br>The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you. Can you ride?
<br>It will be quicker this way.
<br>
<br>"My name is Firenze," he added, as he lowered himself on to his front
<br>legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.
<br>
<br>There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the
<br>clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks
<br>heaving and sweaty.
<br>
<br>"Firenze!" Bane thundered. "What are you doing? You have a human on your
<br>back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?"
<br>
<br>"Do you realize who this is?" said Firenze. "This is the Potter boy. The
<br>quicker he leaves this forest, the better."
<br>
<br>"What have you been telling him?" growled Bane. "Remember, Firenze, we
<br>are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read
<br>what is to come in the movements of the planets?"
<br>
<br>Ronan pawed the ground nervously. "I'm sure Firenze thought he was
<br>acting for the best, " he said in his gloomy voice.
<br>
<br>Bane kicked his back legs in anger.
<br>
<br>"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with
<br>what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like
<br>donkeys after stray humans in our forest!"
<br>
<br>Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had
<br>to grab his shoulders to stay on.
<br>
<br>"Do you not see that unicorn?" Firenze bellowed at Bane. "Do you not
<br>understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that
<br>secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes,
<br>with humans alongside me if I must."
<br>
<br>And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could,
<br>they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.
<br>
<br>Harry didn't have a clue what was going on.
<br>
<br>"Why's Bane so angry?" he asked. "What was that thing you saved me from,
<br>anyway?"
<br>
<br>Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of
<br>low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made
<br>their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought
<br>Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a
<br>particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly
<br>stopped.
<br>
<br>"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?"
<br>
<br>"No," said Harry, startled by the odd question. "We've only used the
<br>horn and tail hair in Potions."
<br>
<br>"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn," said
<br>Firenze. "Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain,
<br>would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive,
<br>even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have
<br>slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have
<br>but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your
<br>lips."
<br>
<br>Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in
<br>the moonlight.
<br>
<br>"But who'd be that desperate?" he wondered aloud. "If you're going to be
<br>cursed forever, deaths better, <b>isn</b> 't it?"
<br>
<br>"It is," Firenze agreed, "unless all you need is to stay alive long
<br>enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to
<br>full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die.
<br>Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very
<br>moment?"
<br>
<br>"The Sorcerer's Stone! Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I don't
<br>understand who --"
<br>
<br>"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power,
<br>who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?"
<br>
<br>It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's
<br>heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what
<br>Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: "Some say he died.
<br>Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to
<br>die."
<br>
<br>"Do you mean," Harry croaked, "that was Vol-"
<br>
<br>"Harry! Harry, are you all right?"
<br>
<br>Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along
<br>behind her.
<br>
<br>"I'm fine," said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. "The
<br>unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there."
<br>
<br>"This is where I leave you," Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to
<br>examine the unicorn. "You are safe now."
<br>
<br>Harry slid off his back.
<br>
<br>"Good luck, Harry Potter," said Firenze. "The planets have been read
<br>wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those
<br>times."
<br>
<br>He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry
<br>shivering behind him.
<br>
<br>Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to
<br>return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly
<br>shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as
<br>Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.
<br>
<br>Harry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He
<br>was still shaking.
<br>
<br>"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort's waiting in the
<br>forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get
<br>rich...."
<br>
<br>"Stop saying the name!" said Ron in a terrified <b>whisper</b> , as if he
<br>thought Voldemort could hear them.
<br>
<br>Harry wasn't listening.
<br>
<br>"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so.... Bane was furious...
<br>he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to
<br>happen.... They must show that Voldemort's coming back.... Bane thinks
<br>Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.... I suppose that's written
<br>in the stars as well."
<br>
<br>"Will you stop saying the name!" Ron hissed.
<br>
<br>"So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to <b>steal</b>  the Stone," Harry
<br>went on feverishly, "then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me
<br>off... Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy."
<br>
<br>Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.
<br>
<br>"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever
<br>afraid of With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you. Anyway,
<br>who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me,
<br>and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic."
<br>
<br>The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed
<br>exhausted, their throats sore. But the night's surprises weren't over.
<br>
<br>When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak
<br>folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:
<br>
<br>Just in case.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER SIXTEEN
<br>
<br>THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR
<br>
<br>In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to
<br>get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting
<br>through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could
<br>be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.
<br>
<br>It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did
<br>their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the
<br>exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating <b>spell</b> .
<br>
<br>They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by
<br>one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across
<br>a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox
<br>-- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if
<br>it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks
<br>while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.
<br>
<br>Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his
<br>forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the
<br>forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because
<br>Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by
<br>his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there
<br>was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.
<br>
<br>Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest,
<br>or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron
<br>and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea
<br>of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in
<br>dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much
<br>time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.
<br>
<br>Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering
<br>questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons
<br>and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam
<br>results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put
<br>down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help
<br>cheering with the rest.
<br>
<br>"That was far easier than I thought it would be," said Hermione as they
<br>joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. "I needn't have
<br>learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of
<br>Elfric the Eager."
<br>
<br>Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron
<br>said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and
<br>flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the
<br>tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. "No
<br>more studying," Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. "You
<br>could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how
<br>badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet."
<br>
<br>Harry was rubbing his forehead.
<br>
<br>"I wish I knew what this means!" he burst out angrily. "My scar keeps
<br>hurting -- it's happened before, but never as often as this."
<br>
<br>"Go to Madam Pomfrey," Hermione suggested.
<br>
<br>"I'm not ill," said Harry. "I think it's a warning... it means danger's
<br>coming...."
<br>
<br>Ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot.
<br>
<br>"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as
<br>Dumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out
<br>how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not
<br>going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for
<br>England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down."
<br>
<br>Harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was
<br>something he'd forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to
<br>explain this, Hermione said, "That's just the exams. I woke up last
<br>night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I
<br>remembered we'd done that one."
<br>
<br>Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do
<br>with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across
<br>the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only
<br>one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore.
<br>Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but --
<br>
<br>Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.
<br>
<br>"Where're you going?" said Ron sleepily.
<br>
<br>"I've just thought of something," said Harry. He had turned white.
<br>"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now."
<br>
<br>"Why?" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.
<br>
<br>"Don't you think it's a bit odd," said Harry, scrambling up the grassy
<br>slope, "that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and
<br>a stranger <b>turns</b>  up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How
<br>many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law?
<br>Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?"
<br>
<br>"What are you talking about?" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the
<br>grounds toward the forest, didn't answer.
<br>
<br>Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and
<br>sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.
<br>
<br>"Hullo," he said, smiling. "Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?"
<br>
<br>"Yes, please," said Ron, but Harry cut him off.
<br>
<br>"No, we're in a hurry. Hagrid, I've got to ask you something. You know
<br>that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards
<br>with look like?"
<br>
<br>"Dunno," said Hagrid casually, "he wouldn' take his cloak off."
<br>
<br>He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.
<br>
<br>"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head --
<br>that's the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn'
<br>he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up."
<br>
<br>Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. "What did you talk to him
<br>about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?"
<br>
<br>"Mighta come up," said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.
<br>"Yeah... he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here....
<br>He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told
<br>him... an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon... an'
<br>then... I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks....
<br>Let's see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play
<br>cards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he
<br>didn' want it ter go ter any old home.... So I told him, after Fluffy, a
<br>dragon would be easy..."
<br>
<br>"And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy?" Harry asked, try ing
<br>to keep his voice calm.
<br>
<br>"Well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around
<br>Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to
<br>calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off
<br>ter sleep --"
<br>
<br>Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.
<br>
<br>"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!" he blurted out. "Forget I said it! Hey --
<br>where're yeh goin'?"
<br>
<br>Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they
<br>came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy
<br>after the grounds.
<br>
<br>"We've got to go to Dumbledore," said Harry. "Hagrid told that stranger
<br>how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that
<br>cloak -- it must've been easy, once he'd got Hagrid drunk. I just hope
<br>Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop
<br>him. Where's Dumbledore's office?"
<br>
<br>They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the
<br>right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor
<br>did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.
<br>
<br>"We'll just have to --" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across
<br>the hall.
<br>
<br>"What are you three doing inside?"
<br>
<br>It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.
<br>
<br>"We want to see Professor Dumbledore," said Hermione, rather bravely,
<br>Harry and Ron thought.
<br>
<br>"See Professor Dumbledore?" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though
<br>this was a very fishy thing to want to do. "Why?"
<br>
<br>Harry swallowed -- now what?
<br>
<br>"It's sort of secret," he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because
<br>Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared.
<br>
<br>"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago," she said coldly. "He
<br>received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for
<br>London at once."
<br>
<br>"He's gone?" said Harry frantically. "Now?"
<br>
<br>"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many
<br>demands on his time --
<br>
<br>"But this is important."
<br>
<br>"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic,
<br>Potter.
<br>
<br>"Look," said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, "Professor -- it's
<br>about the Sorcerer's tone --"
<br>
<br>Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books
<br>she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up.
<br>"How do you know --?" she spluttered.
<br>
<br>"Professor, I think -- I know -- that Sn- that someone's going to try
<br>and <b>steal</b>  the Stone. I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore."
<br>
<br>She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.
<br>
<br>"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow," she said finally. I don't
<br>know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can
<br>possibly <b>steal</b>  it, it's too well protected."
<br>
<br>"But Professor --"
<br>
<br>"Potter, I know what I'm talking about," she said shortly. She bent down
<br>and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and
<br>enjoy the sunshine."
<br>
<br>But they didn't.
<br>
<br>"It's tonight," said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was
<br>out of earshot. "Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight. He's found
<br>out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way. He
<br>sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when
<br>Dumbledore <b>turns</b>  up."
<br>
<br>"But what can we --"
<br>
<br>Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.
<br>
<br>Snape was standing there.
<br>
<br>"Good afternoon," he said smoothly.
<br>
<br>They stared at him.
<br>
<br>"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this," he said, with an odd,
<br>twisted smile.
<br>
<br>"We were --" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.
<br>
<br>"You want to be more careful," said Snape. "Hanging around
<br>
<br>like this, people will think you're up to something. And Gryffindor
<br>really can't afford to lose any more points, can it?"
<br>
<br>Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.
<br>
<br>"Be warned, Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will
<br>personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you."
<br>
<br>He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.
<br>
<br>Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.
<br>
<br>"Right, here's what we've got to do," he whispered urgently. "One of us
<br>has got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and
<br>follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you'd better do that."
<br>
<br>"Why me?"
<br>
<br>"It's obvious," said Ron. "You can pretend to be waiting for Professor
<br>Flitwick, you know." He put on a high voice, "'Oh Professor Flitwick,
<br>I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....'"
<br>
<br>"Oh, shut up," said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for
<br>Snape.
<br>
<br>"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor," Harry told Ron.
<br>"Come on."
<br>
<br>But that part of the plan didn't work. No sooner had they reached the
<br>door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor
<br>McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.
<br>
<br>"I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of
<br>enchantments!" she stormed. "Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you 've
<br>come anywhere near here again, I'll take another <b>fifty</b>  points from
<br>Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!" Harry and Ron went back to
<br>the common room, Harry had just said, "At least Hermione's on Snape's
<br>tail," when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came
<br>in.
<br>
<br>"I'm sorry, Harry!" she wailed. "Snape came out and asked me what I was
<br>doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him,
<br>and I've only just got away, I don't know where Snape went."
<br>
<br>"Well, that's it then, <b>isn</b> 't it?" Harry said.
<br>
<br>The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.
<br>
<br>"I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone
<br>first."
<br>
<br>"You're mad!" said Ron.
<br>
<br>"You can't!" said Hermione. "After what McGonagall and Snape have said?
<br>You'll be expelled!"
<br>
<br>"SO WHAP" Harry shouted. "Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold of
<br>the Stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like
<br>when he was trying to take over? There won't be any Hogwarts to get
<br>expelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the <b>Dark</b> 
<br>Arts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? D'you think
<br>he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house
<br>cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to
<br>go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's
<br>only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over
<br>to the <b>Dark</b>  Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing
<br>you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?"
<br>
<br>He glared at them.
<br>
<br>"You're right Harry," said Hermione in a small voice.
<br>
<br>"I'll use the invisibility cloak," said Harry. "It's just lucky I got it
<br>back."
<br>
<br>"But will it cover all three of us?" said Ron.
<br>
<br>"All -- all three of us?"
<br>
<br>"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?"
<br>
<br>"Of course not," said Hermione briskly. "How do you think you'd get to
<br>the Stone without us? I'd better go and took through my books, there
<br>might be something useful..."
<br>
<br>"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too."
<br>
<br>"Not if I can help it," said Hermione grimly. "Flitwick told me in
<br>secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They're not
<br>throwing me out after that."
<br>
<br>After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.
<br>Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to
<br>Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn't been upset
<br>by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come
<br>across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry
<br>and Ron didn't talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they
<br>were about to do.
<br>
<br>Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.
<br>
<br>"Better get the cloak," Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left,
<br>stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He
<br>putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had
<br>given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn't
<br>feel much like singing.
<br>
<br>He ran back down to the common room.
<br>
<br>"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of
<br>us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --"
<br>
<br>"What are you doing?" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville
<br>appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked
<br>as though he'd been making another bid for freedom.
<br>
<br>"Nothing, Neville, nothing," said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak
<br>behind his back.
<br>
<br>Neville stared at their guilty faces.
<br>
<br>"You're going out again," he said.
<br>
<br>"No, no, no," said Hermione. "No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed,
<br>Neville?"
<br>
<br>Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn't afford
<br>to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.
<br>
<br>"You can't go out," said Neville, "you'll be caught again. Gryffindor
<br>will be in even more trouble."
<br>
<br>"You don't understand," said Harry, "this is important."
<br>
<br>But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.
<br>
<br>I won't let you do it," he said, hurrying to stand in front of the
<br>portrait hole. "I'll -- I'll fight you!"
<br>
<br>"Neville, "Ron exploded, "get away from that hole and don't be an idiot
<br>--"
<br>
<br>"Don't you call me an idiot!" said Neville. I don't think you should be
<br>breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to
<br>people!"
<br>
<br>"Yes, but not to us," said Ron in exasperation. "Neville, you don't know
<br>what you're doing."
<br>
<br>He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt
<br>out of sight.
<br>
<br>"Go on then, try and hit me!" said Neville, raising his fists. "I'm
<br>ready!"
<br>
<br>Harry turned to Hermione.
<br>
<br>"Do something," he said desperately.
<br>
<br>Hermione stepped forward.
<br>
<br>"Neville," she said, "I'm really, really sorry about this."
<br>
<br>She raised her wand.
<br>
<br>"Petrificus Totalus!" she cried, pointing it at Neville.
<br>
<br>Neville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole
<br>body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face,
<br>stiff as a board.
<br>
<br>Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so he
<br>couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.
<br>
<br>"What've you done to him?" Harry whispered.
<br>
<br>"It's the full Body-Bind," said Hermione miserably. "Oh, Neville, I'm so
<br>sorry."
<br>
<br>"We had to, Neville, no time to explain," said Harry.
<br>
<br>"You'll understand later, Neville," said Ron as they stepped over him
<br>and pulled on the invisibility cloak.
<br>
<br>But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a
<br>very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked
<br>like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping
<br>down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs.
<br>Norris skulking near the top.
<br>
<br>"Oh, let's kick her, just this once," Ron whispered in Harry's ear, but
<br>Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris
<br>turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything.
<br>
<br>They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the
<br>third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that
<br>people would trip.
<br>
<br>"Who's there?" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed
<br>his wicked black eyes. "Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are
<br>you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?"
<br>
<br>He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.
<br>
<br>"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen."
<br>
<br>Harry had a sudden idea.
<br>
<br>"Peeves," he said, in a hoarse <b>whisper</b> , "the Bloody Baron has his own
<br>reasons for being invisible."
<br>
<br>Peeves <b>almost</b>  fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time
<br>and hovered about a foot off the stairs.
<br>
<br>"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir," he said greasily. "My
<br>mistake, my mistake -- I didn't see you -- of course I didn't, you're
<br>invisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir."
<br>
<br>"I have business here, Peeves," croaked Harry. "Stay away from this
<br>place tonight."
<br>
<br>"I will, sir, I most certainly will," said Peeves, rising up in the air
<br>again. "<b>Hope</b>  your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you."
<br>
<br>And he scooted off
<br>
<br>"Brilliant, Harry!" whispered Ron.
<br>
<br>A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor
<br>-- and the door was already ajar.
<br>
<br>"Well, there you are," Harry said quietly, "Snape's already got past
<br>Fluffy."
<br>
<br>Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them
<br>what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other
<br>two.
<br>
<br>"If you want to go back, I won't blame you," he said. "You can take the
<br>cloak, I won't need it now."
<br>
<br>"Don't be stupid," said Ron.
<br>
<br>"We're coming," said Hermione.
<br>
<br>Harry pushed the door open.
<br>
<br>As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of
<br>the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it
<br>couldn't see them.
<br>
<br>"What's that at its feet?" Hermione whispered.
<br>
<br>"Looks like a harp," said Ron. "Snape must have left it there."
<br>
<br>"It must wake up the moment you stop playing," said Harry. "Well, here
<br>goes..."
<br>
<br>He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but
<br>from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew
<br>breath. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and
<br>fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.
<br>
<br>"Keep playing," Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and
<br>crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath
<br>as they approached the giant heads. "I think we'll be able to pull the
<br>door open," said Ron, peering over the dog's back. "Want to go first,
<br>Hermione?"
<br>
<br>"No, I don't!"
<br>
<br>"All right." Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's
<br>legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and
<br>open.
<br>
<br>"What can you see?" Hermione said anxiously.
<br>
<br>"Nothing -- just black -- there's no way of climbing down, we'll just
<br>have to drop."
<br>
<br>Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his
<br>attention and pointed at himself.
<br>
<br>"You want to go first? Are you sure?" said Ron. "I don't know how deep
<br>this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep."
<br>
<br>Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog
<br>growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell
<br>back into its deep sleep.
<br>
<br>Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no
<br>sign of the bottom.
<br>
<br>He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his
<br>fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, "If anything happens to
<br>me, don't follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to
<br>Dumbledore, right?"
<br>
<br>"Right," said Ron.
<br>
<br>"See you in a minute, I hope...
<br>
<br>And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down,
<br>down and -- FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on
<br>something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the
<br>gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.
<br>
<br>"It's okay!" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp,
<br>which was the open trapdoor, "it's a soft landing, you can jump!"
<br>
<br>Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.
<br>
<br>"What's this stuff?" were his first words.
<br>
<br>"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall.
<br>Come on, Hermione!"
<br>
<br>The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but
<br>Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side.
<br>
<br>"We must be miles under the school , she said.
<br>
<br>"Lucky this plant thing's here, really," said Ron.
<br>
<br>"Lucky!" shrieked Hermione. "Look at you both!"
<br>
<br>She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle
<br>because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist
<br>snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs
<br>had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.
<br>
<br>Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on
<br>her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant
<br>off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster
<br>the plant wound around them.
<br>
<br>"Stop moving!" Hermione ordered them. "I know what this is -- it's
<br>Devil's Snare!"
<br>
<br>"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help," snarled
<br>Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his
<br>neck. "Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!" said Hermione.
<br>
<br>"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it
<br>curled around his chest.
<br>
<br>"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it
<br>likes the dark and the damp
<br>
<br>"So light a fire!" Harry choked.
<br>
<br>"Yes -- of course -- but there's no wood!" Hermione cried, wringing her
<br>hands.
<br>
<br>"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?" Ron bellowed. "ARE YOU A WITCH OR <b>NOT</b> ?"
<br>
<br>"Oh, right!" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,
<br>muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had
<br>used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it
<br>loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.
<br>Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they
<br>were able to pull free.
<br>
<br>"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione," said Harry as he
<br>joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.
<br>
<br>"Yeah," said Ron, "and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis --
<br>'there's no wood,' honestly."
<br>
<br>"This way," said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the
<br>only way forward.
<br>
<br>All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of
<br>water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and
<br>Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart,
<br>he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards'
<br>bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad
<br>enough...
<br>
<br>"Can you hear something?" Ron whispered.
<br>
<br>Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up
<br>ahead.
<br>
<br>"Do you think it's a ghost?"
<br>
<br>"I don't know... sounds like wings to me."
<br>
<br>"There's light ahead -- I can see something moving."
<br>
<br>They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly
<br>lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small,
<br>jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the
<br>opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.
<br>
<br>"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?" said Ron.
<br>
<br>"Probably," said Harry. "They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if
<br>they all swooped down at once... well, there's no other choice... I'll
<br>run."
<br>
<br>He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted
<br>across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at
<br>him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He
<br>pulled the handle, but it was locked.
<br>
<br>The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it
<br>wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.
<br>
<br>"Now what?" said Ron.
<br>
<br>"These birds... they can't be here just for decoration," said Hermione.
<br>
<br>They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering?
<br>
<br>"They're not birds!" Harry said suddenly. "They're keys! Winged keys --
<br>look carefully. So that must mean..." he looked around the chamber while
<br>the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. "... yes -- look!
<br>Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!"
<br>
<br>"But there are hundreds of them!"
<br>
<br>Ron examined the lock on the door.
<br>
<br>"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the
<br>handle."
<br>
<br>They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into
<br>the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the
<br>bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was <b>almost</b>  impossible to
<br>catch one.
<br>
<br>Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He
<br>had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's
<br>weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large
<br>silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and
<br>stuffed roughly into the keyhole.
<br>
<br>"That one!" he called to the others. "That big one -- there -- no, there
<br>-- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side."
<br>
<br>Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into
<br>the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.
<br>
<br>"We've got to close in on it!" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the
<br>key with the damaged wing. "Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione,
<br>stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it. Right,
<br>NOW!"
<br>
<br>Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry
<br>streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and
<br>with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one
<br>hand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber.
<br>
<br>They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in
<br>his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment
<br>the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very
<br>battered now that it had been caught twice.
<br>
<br>"Ready?" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They
<br>nodded. He pulled the door open.
<br>
<br>The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as
<br>they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an
<br>astonishing sight.
<br>
<br>They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black
<br>chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what
<br>looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the
<br>white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering
<br>white chessmen had no faces.
<br>
<br>"Now what do we do?" Harry whispered.
<br>
<br>"It's obvious, <b>isn</b> 't it?" said Ron. "We've got to play our way across
<br>the room."
<br>
<br>Behind the white pieces they could see another door.
<br>
<br>"How?" said Hermione nervously.
<br>
<br>"I think," said Ron, "we're going to have to be chessmen."
<br>
<br>He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the
<br>knight's horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the
<br>ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.
<br>
<br>"Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?" The black knight
<br>nodded. Ron turned to the other two.
<br>
<br>"This needs thinking about 	he said. I suppose we've got to take the
<br>place of three of the black pieces...."
<br>
<br>Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,
<br>"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at
<br>chess --"
<br>
<br>"We're not offended," said Harry quickly. "Just tell us what to do."
<br>
<br>"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90
<br>next to him instead of that castle."
<br>
<br>"What about you?"
<br>
<br>"I'm going to be a knight," said Ron.
<br>
<br>The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a
<br>knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces
<br>and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron,
<br>and Hermione took.
<br>
<br>"White always plays first in chess," said Ron, peering across the board.
<br>"Yes... look..."
<br>
<br>A white pawn had moved forward two squares.
<br>
<br>Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he
<br>sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost?
<br>
<br>"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right."
<br>
<br>Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white
<br>queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he
<br>lay quite still, facedown.
<br>
<br>"Had to let that happen," said Ron, looking shaken. "Leaves you free to
<br>take that bishop, Hermione, go on."
<br>
<br>Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.
<br>Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall.
<br>Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in
<br>danger. He himself darted around the board, taking <b>almost</b>  as many white
<br>pieces as they had lost black ones.
<br>
<br>"We're nearly there," he muttered suddenly. "Let me think let me
<br>think..."
<br>
<br>The white queen turned her blank face toward him.
<br>
<br>"Yes..." said Ron softly, "It's the only way... I've got to be taken."
<br>
<br>"NOF Harry and Hermione shouted.
<br>
<br>"That's chess!" snapped Ron. "You've got to make some sacrifices! I take
<br>one step forward and she'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate
<br>the king, Harry!"
<br>
<br>"But --"
<br>
<br>"Do you want to stop Snape or not?"
<br>
<br>"Ron --"
<br>
<br>"Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!"
<br>
<br>There was no alternative.
<br>
<br>"Ready?" Ron called, his face pale but determined. "Here I go - now,
<br>don't hang around once you've won."
<br>
<br>He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard
<br>across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor -
<br>Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron
<br>to one side. He looked as if he'd been knocked out.
<br>
<br>Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.
<br>
<br>The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had
<br>won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With
<br>one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through
<br>the door and up the next passageway.
<br>
<br>"What if he's --?"
<br>
<br>"He'll be all right," said Harry, trying to convince himself. "What do
<br>you reckon's next?"
<br>
<br>"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put
<br>charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them
<br>alive; that leaves Quirrell's <b>spell</b> , and Snape's."
<br>
<br>They had reached another door.
<br>
<br>"All right?" Harry whispered.
<br>
<br>"Go on."
<br>
<br>Harry pushed it open.
<br>
<br>A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their
<br>robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in
<br>front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out
<br>cold with a bloody lump on its head.
<br>
<br>"I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one," Harry whispered as they
<br>stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. "Come on, I can't
<br>breathe."
<br>
<br>He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what
<br>came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table
<br>with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.
<br>
<br>"Snape's," said Harry. "What do we have to do?"
<br>
<br>They stepped over the <b>threshold</b> , and immediately a fire sprang up behind
<br>them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At
<br>the same instant, black flames <b>shot</b>  up in the doorway leading onward.
<br>They were trapped.
<br>
<br>"Look!" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry
<br>looked over her shoulder to read it:
<br>
<br>Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,
<br>
<br>Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,
<br>
<br>One among us seven will let you move ahead,
<br>
<br>Another will transport the drinker back instead,
<br>
<br>Two among our <b>number</b>  hold only nettle wine,
<br>
<br>Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.
<br>
<br>Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,
<br>
<br>To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:
<br>
<br>First, however slyly the poison tries to hide
<br>
<br>You will always find some on nettle wine's left side;
<br>
<br>Second, different are those who stand at either end,
<br>
<br>But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;
<br>
<br>Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,
<br>
<br>Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;
<br>
<br>Fourth, the second left and the second on the right
<br>
<br>Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.
<br>
<br>Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was
<br>smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.
<br>
<br>"Brilliant," said Hermione. "This <b>isn</b> 't magic -- it's logic -- a puzzle.
<br>A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be
<br>stuck in here forever."
<br>
<br>"But so will we, won't we?" "Of course not," said Hermione. "Everything
<br>we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are
<br>wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us
<br>back through the purple."
<br>
<br>"But how do we know which to drink?"
<br>
<br>"Give me a minute."
<br>
<br>Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the
<br>line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she
<br>clapped her hands.
<br>
<br>"Got it," she said. "The smallest bottle will get us through the black
<br>fire -- toward the Stone."
<br>
<br>Harry looked at the tiny bottle.
<br>
<br>"There's only enough there for one of us," he said. "That's hardly one
<br>swallow."
<br>
<br>They looked at each other.
<br>
<br>"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?"
<br>
<br>Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.
<br>
<br>"You drink that," said Harry. "No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab
<br>brooms from the flying- key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor
<br>and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to
<br>Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while,
<br>but I'm no match for him, really."
<br>
<br>"But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who's with him?"
<br>
<br>"Well -- I was lucky once, wasn't I?" said Harry, pointing at his scar.
<br>"I might get lucky again."
<br>
<br>Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her
<br>arms around him.
<br>
<br>"Hermione!"
<br>
<br>"Harry -- you're a great wizard, you know."
<br>
<br>"I'm not as good as you," said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of
<br>him.
<br>
<br>"Me!" said Hermione. "Books! And cleverness! There are more important
<br>things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!"
<br>
<br>"You drink first," said Harry. "You are sure which is which, aren't
<br>you?"
<br>
<br>"Positive," said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle
<br>at the end, and shuddered.
<br>
<br>"It's not poison?" said Harry anxiously.
<br>
<br>"No -- but it's like ice."
<br>
<br>"Quick, go, before it wears off."
<br>
<br>"Good luck -- take care."
<br>
<br>"GO!"
<br>
<br>Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.
<br>
<br>Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to
<br>face the black flames.
<br>
<br>"Here I come," he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.
<br>
<br>It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle
<br>down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking
<br>his body, but couldn't feel them -- for a moment he could see nothing
<br>but dark fire -- then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.
<br>
<br>There was already someone there -- but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even
<br>Voldemort.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
<br>
<br>THE MAN WITH TWO FACES
<br>
<br>It was Quirrell.
<br>
<br>"You!" gasped Harry.
<br>
<br>Quirrell smiled. His face wasn't twitching at all.
<br>
<br>"Me," he said calmly. "I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here,
<br>Potter."
<br>
<br>"But I thought -- Snape --"
<br>
<br>"Severus?" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble,
<br>either, but cold and sharp. "Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't
<br>he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to
<br>him, who would suspect p-p-<b>poor</b> , st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?"
<br>
<br>Harry couldn't take it in. This couldn't be true, it couldn't.
<br>
<br>"But Snape tried to kill me!"
<br>
<br>"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally
<br>knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch
<br>match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd
<br>have got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape
<br>hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you."
<br>
<br>"Snape was trying to save me?"
<br>
<br>"Of course," said Quirrell coolly. "\Why do you think he wanted to
<br>referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it
<br>again. Funny, really... he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything
<br>with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was
<br>trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular...
<br>and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you
<br>tonight."
<br>
<br>Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped
<br>themselves tightly around Harry.
<br>
<br>"You're too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on
<br>Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what
<br>was guarding the Stone."
<br>
<br>"You let the troll in?"
<br>
<br>"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what
<br>I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while
<br>everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already
<br>suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not
<br>only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog
<br>didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly.
<br>
<br>"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.
<br>
<br>It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell.
<br>It was the Mirror of Erised.
<br>
<br>"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone," Quirrell murmured,
<br>tapping his way around the frame. "Trust Dumbledore to come up with
<br>something like this... but he's in London... I'll be far away by the
<br>time he gets back...."
<br>
<br>All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him
<br>from concentrating on the mirror.
<br>
<br>"I saw you and Snape in the forest --" he blurted out.
<br>
<br>"Yes," said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the
<br>back. "He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got.
<br>He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me - as though he could,
<br>when I had Lord Voldemort on my side...."
<br>
<br>Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into
<br>it.
<br>
<br>"I see the Stone... I'm presenting it to my master... but where is it?"
<br>
<br>Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He
<br>had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.
<br>
<br>"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much."
<br>
<br>"Oh, he does," said Quirrell casually, "heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts
<br>with your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other. But he never
<br>wanted you dead."
<br>
<br>"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was
<br>threatening you...."
<br>
<br>For the first time, a <b>spasm</b>  of fear flitted across Quirrell's face.
<br>
<br>"Sometimes," he said, "I find it hard to follow my master's instructions
<br>-- he is a great wizard and I am weak --"
<br>
<br>"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?" Harry gasped.
<br>
<br>"He is with me wherever I go," said Quirrell quietly. "I met him when I
<br>traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of
<br>ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong
<br>I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too
<br>weak to seek it.... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I
<br>have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me."
<br>Quirrell shivered suddenly. "He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I
<br>failed to <b>steal</b>  the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He
<br>punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me...."
<br>
<br>Quirrell's voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon
<br>Alley -how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that
<br>very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.
<br>
<br>Quirrell cursed under his breath.
<br>
<br>"I don't understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break
<br>it?"
<br>
<br>Harry's mind was racing.
<br>
<br>What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he
<br>thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the
<br>mirror, I should see myseff finding it -- which means I'll see where
<br>it's hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up
<br>to?
<br>
<br>He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without
<br>Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he
<br>tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to
<br>himself. "What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!"
<br>
<br>And to Harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come
<br>from Quirrell himself
<br>
<br>"Use the boy... Use the boy..."
<br>
<br>Quirrell rounded on Harry.
<br>
<br>"Yes -- Potter -- come here."
<br>
<br>He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry
<br>got slowly to his feet.
<br>
<br>"Come here," Quirrell repeated. "Look in the mirror and tell me what you
<br>see."
<br>
<br>Harry walked toward him.
<br>
<br>I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I
<br>see, that's all.
<br>
<br>Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that
<br>seemed to come from Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in
<br>front of the mirror, and opened them again.
<br>
<br>He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment
<br>later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and
<br>pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its
<br>pocket -- and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his
<br>real pocket. Somehow -- incredibly -- he'd gotten the Stone.
<br>
<br>"Well?" said Quirrell impatiently. "What do you see?"
<br>
<br>Harry screwed up his courage.
<br>
<br>"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore," he invented. "I -- I've
<br>won the house cup for Gryffindor."
<br>
<br>Quirrell cursed again.
<br>
<br>"Get out of the way," he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the
<br>Sorcerer's Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?
<br>
<br>But he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though
<br>Quirrell wasn't moving his lips.
<br>
<br>"He lies... He lies..."
<br>
<br>"Potter, come back here!" Quirrell shouted. "Tell me the truth! What did
<br>you just see?"
<br>
<br>The high voice spoke again.
<br>
<br>"Let me speak to him... face-to-face..."
<br>
<br>"Master, you are not strong enough!"
<br>
<br>"I have strength enough... for this...."
<br>
<br>Harry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn't
<br>move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to
<br>unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell's
<br>head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the
<br>spot.
<br>
<br>Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound. Where there
<br>should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most
<br>terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red
<br>eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.
<br>
<br>"Harry Potter..." it whispered.
<br>
<br>Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move.
<br>
<br>"See what I have become?" the face said. "Mere shadow and vapor ... I
<br>have form only when I can share another's body... but there have always
<br>been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... Unicorn
<br>blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell
<br>drinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life,
<br>I will be able to create a body of my own.... Now... why don't you give
<br>me that Stone in your pocket?"
<br>
<br>So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry's legs. He
<br>stumbled backward.
<br>
<br>"Don't be a fool," snarled the face. "Better save your own life and join
<br>me... or you'll meet the same end as your parents.... They died begging
<br>me for mercy..."
<br>
<br>"LIAR!" Harry shouted suddenly.
<br>
<br>Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see
<br>him. The evil face was now smiling.
<br>
<br>"How touching..." it hissed. "I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your
<br>parents were brave.... I killed your father first; and he put up a
<br>courageous fight... but your mother needn't have died... she was trying
<br>to protect you.... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have
<br>died in vain."
<br>
<br>"NEVER!"
<br>
<br>Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed "SEIZE HIM!"
<br>and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist. At
<br>once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt as
<br>though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his
<br>might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head
<br>lessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and
<br>saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers -- they were blistering
<br>before his eyes.
<br>
<br>"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged,
<br>knocking Harry clean off his feet' landing on top of him, both hands
<br>around Harry's neck -- Harry's scar was <b>almost</b>  blinding him with pain,
<br>yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.
<br>
<br>"Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!"
<br>
<br>And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go
<br>of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry could see
<br>they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
<br>
<br>"Then kill him, fool, and be done!" screeched Voldemort.
<br>
<br>Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by
<br>instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face --
<br>
<br>"AAAARGH!"
<br>
<br>Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew:
<br>Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible
<br>pain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough
<br>pain to stop him from doing a curse.
<br>
<br>Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as
<br>tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off -- the
<br>pain in Harry's head was building -- he couldn't see -- he could only
<br>hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, "KILL HIM!
<br>KILL HIM!" and other voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying, "Harry!
<br>Harry!"
<br>
<br>He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and
<br>fell into blackness, down ... down... down...
<br>
<br>Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to
<br>catch it, but his arms were too heavy.
<br>
<br>He blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How
<br>strange.
<br>
<br>He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view
<br>above him.
<br>
<br>"Good afternoon, Harry," said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he
<br>remembered: "Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He's got the Stone! Sir,
<br>quick --"
<br>
<br>"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times," said
<br>Dumbledore. "Quirrell does not have the Stone."
<br>
<br>"Then who does? Sir, I --"
<br>
<br>"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.
<br>
<br>Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the
<br>hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next
<br>to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.
<br>
<br>"Tokens from your friends and admirers," said Dumbledore, beaming. "What
<br>happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a
<br>complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your
<br>friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to
<br>send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam
<br>Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated
<br>it."
<br>
<br>"How long have I been in here?"
<br>
<br>"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved
<br>you have come round, they have been extremely worried."
<br>
<br>"But sit, the Stone
<br>
<br>I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor
<br>Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to
<br>prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.
<br>
<br>"You got there? You got Hermione's owl?"
<br>
<br>"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it
<br>became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just
<br>left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you."
<br>
<br>"It was you."
<br>
<br>"I feared I might be too late."
<br>
<br>"You nearly were, I couldn't have kept him off the Stone much longer --"
<br>
<br>"Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For
<br>one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has
<br>been destroyed."
<br>
<br>"Destroyed?" said Harry blankly. "But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel --"
<br>
<br>"Oh, you know about Nicolas?" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted.
<br>"You did do the thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have had
<br>a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best."
<br>
<br>"But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?"
<br>
<br>"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then,
<br>yes, they will die."
<br>
<br>Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face.
<br>
<br>"To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas
<br>and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long
<br>day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great
<br>adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As
<br>much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings
<br>would choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of
<br>choosing precisely those things that are worst for them." Harry lay
<br>there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the
<br>ceiling.
<br>
<br>"Sir?" said Harry. "I've been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone's
<br>gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --"
<br>
<br>"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear
<br>of a name increases fear of the thing itself."
<br>
<br>"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back,
<br><b>isn</b> 't he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?"
<br>
<br>"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking
<br>for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.
<br>He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers
<br>as his <b>enemies</b> . Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his
<br>return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to
<br>fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed
<br>again, and again, why, he may never return to power."
<br>
<br>Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then
<br>he said, "Sir, there are some other things I'd like to know, if you can
<br>tell me... things I want to know the truth about...."
<br>
<br>"The truth." Dumbledore sighed. "It is a beautiful and terrible thing,
<br>and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall
<br>answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which
<br>case I beg you'll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie."
<br>
<br>"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried
<br>to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the
<br>first place?"
<br>
<br>Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.
<br>
<br>"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not
<br>now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry.
<br>When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are
<br>ready, you will know."
<br>
<br>And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.
<br>
<br>"But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?"
<br>
<br>"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot
<br>understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your
<br>mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to
<br>have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone,
<br>will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell,
<br>full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort,
<br>could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person
<br>marked by something so good."
<br>
<br>Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill,
<br>which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found
<br>his voice again, Harry said, "And the invisibility cloak - do you know
<br>who sent it to me?"
<br>
<br>"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought
<br>you might like it." Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. "Useful things... your
<br>father used it mainly for <b>sneaking</b>  off to the kitchens to <b>steal</b>  food
<br>when he was here."
<br>
<br>"And there's something else..."
<br>
<br>"Fire away."
<br>
<br>"Quirrell said Snape --"
<br>
<br>"Professor Snape, Harry." "Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because
<br>he hated my father. Is that true?"
<br>
<br>"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr.
<br>Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive."
<br>
<br>"What?"
<br>
<br>"He saved his life."
<br>
<br>"What?"
<br>
<br>"Yes..." said Dumbledore dreamily. "Funny, the way people's minds work,
<br><b>isn</b> 't it? Professor Snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt....
<br>I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt
<br>that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to
<br>hating your father's memory in peace...."
<br>
<br>Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he
<br>stopped.
<br>
<br>"And sir, there's one more thing..."
<br>
<br>"Just the one?"
<br>
<br>"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?"
<br>
<br>"Ah, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant
<br>ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only
<br>one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be
<br>able to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or
<br>drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes.... Now,
<br>enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie
<br>Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come
<br>across a vomitflavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've rather lost
<br>my liking for them -- but I think I'll be safe with a nice toffee, don't
<br>you?"
<br>
<br>He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he
<br>choked and said, "Alas! Ear wax!"
<br>
<br>Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.
<br>
<br>"Just five minutes," Harry pleaded.
<br>
<br>"Absolutely not."
<br>
<br>"You let Professor Dumbledore in..."
<br>
<br>"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need
<br>rest."
<br>
<br>"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam
<br>Pomfrey..."
<br>
<br>"Oh, very well," she said. "But five minutes only."
<br>
<br>And she let Ron and Hermione in.
<br>
<br>"Harry!"
<br>
<br>Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was
<br>glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.
<br>
<br>"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried
<br>--"
<br>
<br>"The whole school's talking about it," said Ron. "What really happened?"
<br>
<br>It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more
<br>strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything:
<br>Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a
<br>very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry
<br>told them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.
<br>
<br>"So the Stone's gone?" said Ron finally. "Flamel's just going to die?"
<br>
<br>"That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- 'to
<br>the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.
<br>
<br>"I always said he was off his rocker," said Ron, looking quite impressed
<br>at how crazy his hero was.
<br>
<br>"So what happened to you two?" said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Well, I got back all right," said Hermione. "I brought Ron round --
<br>that took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact
<br>Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he
<br>just said, 'Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?' and hurtled off to the
<br>third floor."
<br>
<br>"D'you think he meant you to do it?" said Ron. "Sending you your
<br>father's cloak and everything?"
<br>
<br>"Well, " Hermione exploded, "if he did -- I mean to say that's terrible
<br>-- you could have been killed."
<br>
<br>"No, it <b>isn</b> 't," said Harry thoughtfully. "He's a funny man, Dumbledore.
<br>I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or
<br>less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty
<br>good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just
<br>taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me
<br>find out how the mirror worked. It's <b>almost</b>  like he thought I had the
<br>right to face Voldemort if I could...."
<br>
<br>"Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right," said Ron proudly.
<br>"Listen, you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The
<br>points are all in and Slytherin won, of course -- you missed the last
<br>Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but
<br>the food'll be good."
<br>
<br>At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.
<br>
<br>"You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT" she said firmly.
<br>
<br>After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.
<br>
<br>I want to go to the feast," he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened
<br>his many candy boxes. I can, can't I?"
<br>
<br>"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go," she said
<br>stiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn't realize
<br>how risky feasts could be. "And you have another visitor."
<br>
<br>"Oh, good," said Harry. "Who is it?"
<br>
<br>Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was
<br>indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry,
<br>took one look at him, and burst into tears.
<br>
<br>"It's -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!" he sobbed, his face in his hands.
<br>I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only
<br>thing he didn't know, an' I told him! Yeh could've died! All fer a
<br>dragon egg! I'll never drink again! I should be chucked out an' made ter
<br>live as a Muggle!"
<br>
<br>"Hagrid!" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and
<br>remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. "Hagrid, he'd have
<br>found out somehow, this is Voldemort we're talking about, he'd have
<br>found out even if you hadn't told him."
<br>
<br>"Yeh could've died!" sobbed Hagrid. "An' don' say the name!"
<br>
<br>"VOLDEMORT!" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped
<br>crying. "I've met him and I'm calling him by his name. Please cheer up,
<br>Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it's gone, he can't use it. Have a Chocolate
<br>Frog, I've got loads...."
<br>
<br>Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, "That reminds
<br>me. I've got yeh a present."
<br>
<br>"It's not a stoat sandwich, is it?" said Harry anxiously, and at last
<br>Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. "Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off
<br>yesterday ter fix it. 'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway,
<br>got yeh this..."
<br>
<br>It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it
<br>curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him
<br>from every page were his mother and father.
<br>
<br>"Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer
<br>photos... knew yeh didn' have any... d'yeh like it?"
<br>
<br>Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.
<br>
<br>Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He
<br>had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving
<br>him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked
<br>out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's
<br>winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner
<br>showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.
<br>
<br>When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started
<br>talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione
<br>at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were
<br>standing up to look at him.
<br>
<br>Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.
<br>
<br>"Another year gone!" Dumbledore said cheerfully. "And I must trouble you
<br>with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our
<br>delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a
<br>little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get
<br>them nice and empty before next year starts....
<br>
<br>"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the
<br>points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and
<br>twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and <b>fifty</b> -two;
<br>Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred
<br>and seventy- two."
<br>
<br>A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.
<br>Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a
<br>sickening sight.
<br>
<br>"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin," said Dumbledore. "However, recent
<br>events must be taken into account."
<br>
<br>The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.
<br>
<br>"Ahem," said Dumbledore. "I have a few last-minute points to dish out.
<br>Let me see. Yes...
<br>
<br>"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley..."
<br>
<br>Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.
<br>
<br>"...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I
<br>award Gryffindor house <b>fifty</b>  points."
<br>
<br>Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars
<br>overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other
<br>prefects, "My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past
<br>McGonagall's giant chess set!"
<br>
<br>At last there was silence again.
<br>
<br>"Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the
<br>face of fire, I award Gryffindor house <b>fifty</b>  points."
<br>
<br>Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had
<br>burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside
<br>themselves -- they were a hundred points up. "Third -- to Mr. Harry
<br>Potter..." said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve
<br>and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points."
<br>
<br>The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves
<br>hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points
<br>-- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if
<br>only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.
<br>
<br>Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.
<br>
<br>"There are all kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, smiling. "It takes a
<br>great deal of bravery to stand up to our <b>enemies</b> , but just as much to
<br>stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville
<br>Longbottom."
<br>
<br>Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some
<br>sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted
<br>from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and
<br>cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people
<br>hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.
<br>Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who
<br>couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the
<br>Body-Bind Curse put on him.
<br>
<br>"Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even
<br>Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, "we
<br>need a little change of decoration."
<br>
<br>He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet
<br>and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a
<br>towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor
<br>McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye
<br>and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed
<br>one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back
<br>to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.
<br>
<br>It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at
<br>Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would
<br>never, ever forget tonight.
<br>
<br>Harry had <b>almost</b>  forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but
<br>come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good
<br>marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even
<br>Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his
<br>abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was <b>almost</b>  as stupid
<br>as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a
<br>shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.
<br>
<br>And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed,
<br>Neville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were
<br>handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the
<br>holidays ("I always hope they'll forget to give us these," said Fred
<br>Weasley <b>sadly</b> ); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats
<br>that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express;
<br>talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier;
<br>eating Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns;
<br>pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling
<br>into platform nine and three-quarters at King's Cross Station.
<br>
<br>It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened
<br>old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate
<br>in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out
<br>of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.
<br>
<br>"You must come and stay this summer," said Ron, "both of you -- I'll
<br>send you an owl."
<br>
<br>"Thanks," said Harry, "I'll need something to look forward to." People
<br>jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle
<br>world. Some of them called:
<br>
<br>"Bye, Harry!"
<br>
<br>"See you, Potter!"
<br>
<br>"Still famous," said Ron, grinning at him.
<br>
<br>"Not where I'm going, I promise you," said Harry.
<br>
<br>He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. "There he is,
<br>Mom, there he is, look!"
<br>
<br>It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at
<br>Ron.
<br>
<br>"Harry Potter!" she squealed. "Look, Mom! I can see
<br>
<br>"Be quiet, Ginny, and it's rude to point."
<br>
<br>Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.
<br>
<br>"Busy year?" she said.
<br>
<br>"Very," said Harry. "Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs.
<br>Weasley."
<br>
<br>"Oh, it was nothing, dear."
<br>
<br>"Ready, are you?"
<br>
<br>It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking
<br>furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station
<br>full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley,
<br>looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.
<br>
<br>"You must be Harry's family!" said Mrs. Weasley.
<br>
<br>"In a manner of speaking," said Uncle Vernon. "Hurry up, boy, we haven't
<br>got all day." He walked away.
<br>
<br>Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.
<br>
<br>"See you over the summer, then."
<br>
<br>"<b>Hope</b>  you have -- er -- a good holiday," said Hermione, looking
<br>uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so
<br>unpleasant.
<br>
<br>"Oh, I will," said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was
<br>spreading over his face. "They don't know we're not allowed to use magic
<br>at home. I'm going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...."
<br>
<br>THE END
