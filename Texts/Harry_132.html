<br>CHAPTER ONE
<br>
<br>THE BOY WHO LIVED
<br>
<br>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
<br>that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last
<br>people you'd expect to be involved <b>in</b>  anything strange or mysterious,
<br>because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
<br>
<br>Mr. Dursley was the director of <b>a</b>  firm called Grunnings, which made
<br>drills. He was <b>a</b>  big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did
<br>have <b>a</b>  very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had
<br>nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came <b>in</b>  very useful as she
<br>spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
<br>neighbors. The Dursleys had <b>a</b>  small son called Dudley and <b>in</b>  their
<br>opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
<br>
<br>The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had <b>a</b>  secret, and
<br>their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't
<br>think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.
<br>Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;
<br><b>in</b>  fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have <b>a</b>  sister, because her
<br>sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was
<br>possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would
<br>say if the Potters arrived <b>in</b>  the street. The Dursleys knew that the
<br>Potters had <b>a</b>  small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy
<br>was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want
<br>Dudley mixing with <b>a</b>  child like that.
<br>
<br>When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story
<br>starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that
<br>strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the
<br>country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for
<br>work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled <b>a</b>  screaming
<br>Dudley into his high chair.
<br>
<br>None of them noticed <b>a</b>  large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
<br>
<br><b>At</b>  half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.
<br>Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,
<br>because Dudley was now having <b>a</b>  tantrum and throwing his cereal <b>at</b>  the
<br>walls. "Little tyke," chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got
<br>into his car and backed out of number four's drive.
<br>
<br>It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of
<br>something peculiar -- <b>a</b>  cat reading <b>a</b>  map. For <b>a</b>  second, Mr. Dursley
<br>didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to
<br>look again. There was <b>a</b>  tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet
<br>Drive, but there wasn't <b>a</b>  map <b>in</b>  sight. What could he have been thinking
<br>of? It must have been <b>a</b>  trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and
<br>stared <b>at</b>  the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the
<br>corner and up the road, he watched the cat <b>in</b>  his mirror. It was now
<br>reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking <b>at</b>  the sign; cats
<br>couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself <b>a</b>  little shake and
<br>put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of
<br>nothing except <b>a</b>  large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.
<br>
<br>But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something
<br>else. As he sat <b>in</b>  the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help
<br>noticing that there seemed to be <b>a</b>  lot of strangely dressed people
<br>about. People <b>in</b>  cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed <b>in</b> 
<br>funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this
<br>was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering
<br>wheel and his eyes fell on <b>a</b>  huddle of these weirdos standing quite
<br>close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was
<br>enraged to see that <b>a</b>  couple of them weren't young <b>at</b>  all; why, that man
<br>had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The
<br>nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some
<br>silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something...
<br>yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and <b>a</b>  few minutes later, Mr.
<br>Dursley arrived <b>in</b>  the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.
<br>
<br>Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window <b>in</b>  his office on the
<br>ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate
<br>on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past <b>in</b>  broad
<br>daylight, though people down <b>in</b>  the street did; they pointed and gazed
<br>open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never
<br>seen an owl even <b>at</b>  nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had <b>a</b>  perfectly
<br>normal, owl-free morning. He yelled <b>at</b>  five different people. He made
<br>several important telephone calls and shouted <b>a</b>  bit more. He was <b>in</b>  <b>a</b> 
<br>very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs
<br>and walk across the road to buy himself <b>a</b>  bun from the bakery.
<br>
<br>He'd forgotten all about the people <b>in</b>  cloaks until he passed <b>a</b>  group of
<br>them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't
<br>know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering
<br>excitedly, too, and he couldn't see <b>a</b>  single collecting tin. It was on
<br>his way back past them, clutching <b>a</b>  large doughnut <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  bag, that he
<br>caught <b>a</b>  few words of what they were saying.
<br>
<br>"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry"
<br>
<br>Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back <b>at</b>  the
<br>whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better
<br>of it.
<br>
<br>He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped <b>at</b>  his
<br>secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost
<br>finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the
<br>receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was
<br>being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were
<br>lots of people called Potter who had <b>a</b>  son called Harry. Come to think
<br>of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even
<br>seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point
<br><b>in</b>  worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset <b>at</b>  any mention of her
<br>sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had <b>a</b>  sister like that... but all
<br>the same, those people <b>in</b>  cloaks...
<br>
<br>He found it <b>a</b>  lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and
<br>when he left the building <b>at</b>  five o'clock, he was still so worried that
<br>he walked straight into someone just outside the door.
<br>
<br>"Sorry," he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It
<br>was <b>a</b>  few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing <b>a</b> 
<br>violet cloak. He didn't seem <b>at</b>  all upset <b>at</b>  being almost knocked to the
<br>ground. On the contrary, his face split into <b>a</b>  wide smile and he said <b>in</b> 
<br><b>a</b>  squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir,
<br>for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone <b>at</b> 
<br>last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy,
<br>happy day!"
<br>
<br>And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.
<br>
<br>Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by <b>a</b>  complete
<br>stranger. He also thought he had been called <b>a</b>  Muggle, whatever that
<br>was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping
<br>he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he
<br>didn't approve of imagination.
<br>
<br>As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw --
<br>and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that
<br>morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the
<br>same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.
<br>
<br>"Shoo!" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him <b>a</b> 
<br>stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying
<br>to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still
<br>determined not to mention anything to his wife.
<br>
<br>Mrs. Dursley had had <b>a</b>  nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all
<br>about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had
<br>learned <b>a</b>  new word ("Won't!"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When
<br>Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room <b>in</b>  time to
<br>catch the last report on the evening news:
<br>
<br>"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's
<br>owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally
<br>hunt <b>at</b>  night and are hardly ever seen <b>in</b>  daylight, there have been
<br>hundreds of sightings of these birds flying <b>in</b>  every direction since
<br>sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly
<br>changed their sleeping pattern." The newscaster allowed himself <b>a</b>  grin.
<br>"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going
<br>to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?"
<br>
<br>"Well, Ted," said the weatherman, "I don't know about that, but it's not
<br>only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as
<br>Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning <b>in</b>  to tell me that instead
<br>of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had <b>a</b>  downpour of shooting
<br>stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's
<br>not until next week, folks! But I can promise <b>a</b>  wet night tonight."
<br>
<br>Mr. Dursley sat frozen <b>in</b>  his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?
<br>Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people <b>in</b>  cloaks all over the place?
<br>And <b>a</b>  whisper, <b>a</b>  whisper about the Potters...
<br>
<br>Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was
<br>no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat
<br>nervously. "Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister
<br>lately, have you?"
<br>
<br>As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,
<br>they normally pretended she didn't have <b>a</b>  sister.
<br>
<br>"No," she said sharply. "Why?"
<br>
<br>"Funny stuff on the news," Mr. Dursley mumbled. "Owls... shooting
<br>stars... and there were <b>a</b>  lot of funny-looking people <b>in</b>  town today..."
<br>
<br>"So?" snapped Mrs. Dursley.
<br>
<br>"Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to <b>do</b>  with... you
<br>know... her crowd."
<br>
<br>Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered
<br>whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name "Potter." He decided he
<br>didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, "Their son --
<br>he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?"
<br>
<br>"I suppose so," said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.
<br>
<br>"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?"
<br>
<br>"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me."
<br>
<br>"Oh, yes," said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. "Yes, I quite
<br>agree."
<br>
<br>He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.
<br>While Mrs. Dursley was <b>in</b>  the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom
<br>window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there.
<br>It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for
<br>something.
<br>
<br>Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to <b>do</b>  with the
<br>Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to <b>a</b>  pair of
<br>-- well, he didn't think he could bear it.
<br>
<br>The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.
<br>Dursley lay awake, turning it all over <b>in</b>  his mind. His last, comforting
<br>thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were
<br>involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs.
<br>Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about
<br>them and their kind.... He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get
<br>mixed up <b>in</b>  anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over
<br>-- it couldn't affect them....
<br>
<br>How very wrong he was.
<br>
<br>Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat
<br>on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as
<br>still as <b>a</b>  statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of
<br>Privet Drive. It didn't so much as quiver when <b>a</b>  car door slammed on the
<br>next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. <b>In</b>  fact, it was nearly
<br>midnight before the cat moved <b>at</b>  all.
<br>
<br><b>A</b>  man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so
<br>suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the
<br>ground. The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.
<br>
<br>Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,
<br>thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which
<br>were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes,
<br><b>a</b>  purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.
<br>His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon
<br>spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been
<br>broken <b>at</b>  least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.
<br>
<br>Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived <b>in</b>  <b>a</b> 
<br>street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was
<br>busy rummaging <b>in</b>  his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to
<br>realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly <b>at</b>  the cat,
<br>which was still staring <b>at</b>  him from the other end of the street. For
<br>some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and
<br>muttered, "I should have known."
<br>
<br>He found what he was looking for <b>in</b>  his inside pocket. It seemed to be <b>a</b> 
<br>silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up <b>in</b>  the air, and
<br>clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with <b>a</b>  little pop. He
<br>clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times
<br>he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street
<br>were two tiny pinpricks <b>in</b>  the distance, which were the eyes of the cat
<br>watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed
<br>Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening
<br>down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his
<br>cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down
<br>on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look <b>at</b>  it, but after <b>a</b>  moment he
<br>spoke to it.
<br>
<br>"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall."
<br>
<br>He turned to smile <b>at</b>  the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling
<br><b>at</b>  <b>a</b>  rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly
<br>the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was
<br>wearing <b>a</b>  cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into <b>a</b>  tight
<br>bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.
<br>
<br>"How did you know it was me?" she asked.
<br>
<br>"My dear Professor, I 've never seen <b>a</b>  cat <b>sit</b>  so stiffly."
<br>
<br>"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on <b>a</b>  brick wall all day," said
<br>Professor McGonagall.
<br>
<br>"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed <b>a</b> 
<br>dozen feasts and parties on my way here."
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
<br>
<br>"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right," she said impatiently.
<br>"You'd think they'd be <b>a</b>  bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles
<br>have noticed something's going on. It was on their news." She jerked her
<br>head back <b>at</b>  the Dursleys' dark living-room window. "I heard it. Flocks
<br>of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they're not completely stupid. They
<br>were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down <b>in</b>  Kent -- I'll bet
<br>that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense."
<br>
<br>"You can't blame them," said Dumbledore gently. "We've had precious
<br>little to celebrate for eleven years."
<br>
<br>"I know that," said Professor McGonagall irritably. "But that's no
<br>reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on
<br>the streets <b>in</b>  broad daylight, not even dressed <b>in</b>  Muggle clothes,
<br>swapping rumors."
<br>
<br>She threw <b>a</b>  sharp, sideways glance <b>at</b>  Dumbledore here, as though hoping
<br>he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. "<b>A</b> 
<br>fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have
<br>disappeared <b>at</b>  last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he
<br>really has gone, Dumbledore?"
<br>
<br>"It certainly seems so," said Dumbledore. "We have much to be thankful
<br>for. Would you care for <b>a</b>  lemon drop?"
<br>
<br>"<b>A</b>  what?"
<br>
<br>"<b>A</b>  lemon drop. They're <b>a</b>  kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of"
<br>
<br>"No, thank you," said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't
<br>think this was the moment for lemon drops. "As I say, even if
<br>You-Know-Who has gone -"
<br>
<br>"My dear Professor, surely <b>a</b>  sensible person like yourself can call him
<br>by his name? All this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense -- for eleven years I
<br>have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name:
<br>Voldemort." Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was
<br>unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. "It all gets so
<br>confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason
<br>to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name.
<br>
<br>"I know you haven 't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half
<br>exasperated, half admiring. "But you're different. Everyone knows you're
<br>the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of."
<br>
<br>"You flatter me," said Dumbledore calmly. "Voldemort had powers I will
<br>never have."
<br>
<br>"Only because you're too -- well -- noble to use them."
<br>
<br>"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey
<br>told me she liked my new earmuffs."
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall shot <b>a</b>  sharp look <b>at</b>  Dumbledore and said, "The owls
<br>are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what
<br>everyone's saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally
<br>stopped him?"
<br>
<br>It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most
<br>anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on <b>a</b>  cold, hard
<br>wall all day, for neither as <b>a</b>  cat nor as <b>a</b>  woman had she fixed
<br>Dumbledore with such <b>a</b>  piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that
<br>whatever "everyone" was saying, she was not going to believe it until
<br>Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing
<br>another lemon drop and did not answer.
<br>
<br>"What they're saying," she pressed on, "is that last night Voldemort
<br>turned up <b>in</b>  Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is
<br>that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they're -- dead. "
<br>
<br>Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.
<br>
<br>"Lily and James... I can't believe it... I didn't want to believe it...
<br>Oh, Albus..."
<br>
<br>Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. "I know... I
<br>know..." he said heavily.
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. "That's not all.
<br>They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But -- he
<br>couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how,
<br>but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's
<br>power somehow broke -- and that's why he's gone.
<br>
<br>Dumbledore nodded glumly.
<br>
<br>"It's -- it's true?" faltered Professor McGonagall. "After all he's
<br>done... all the people he's killed... he couldn't kill <b>a</b>  little boy?
<br>It's just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how <b>in</b>  the
<br>name of heaven did Harry survive?"
<br>
<br>"We can only guess," said Dumbledore. "We may never know."
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall pulled out <b>a</b>  lace handkerchief and dabbed <b>at</b>  her
<br>eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave <b>a</b>  great sniff as he took <b>a</b> 
<br>golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was <b>a</b>  very odd watch.
<br>It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving
<br>around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because
<br>he put it back <b>in</b>  his pocket and said, "Hagrid's late. I suppose it was
<br>he who told you I'd be here, by the way?"
<br>
<br>"Yes," said Professor McGonagall. "And I don't suppose you're going to
<br>tell me why you're here, of all places?"
<br>
<br>"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They're the only family
<br>he has left now."
<br>
<br>"You don't mean -- you can't mean the people who live here?" cried
<br>Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing <b>at</b>  number four.
<br>"Dumbledore -- you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't
<br>find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son -- I saw
<br>him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.
<br>Harry Potter come and live here!"
<br>
<br>"It's the best place for him," said Dumbledore firmly. "His aunt and
<br>uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've
<br>written them <b>a</b>  letter."
<br>
<br>"<b>A</b>  letter?" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on
<br>the wall. "Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this <b>in</b>  <b>a</b> 
<br>letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous -- <b>a</b> 
<br>legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day
<br><b>in</b>  the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child
<br><b>in</b>  our world will know his name!"
<br>
<br>"Exactly," said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his
<br>half-moon glasses. "It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous
<br>before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even
<br>remember! CarA you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away
<br>from all that until he's ready to take it?"
<br>
<br>Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and
<br>then said, "Yes -- yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy
<br>getting here, Dumbledore?" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she
<br>thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.
<br>
<br>"Hagrid's bringing him."
<br>
<br>"You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as
<br>this?"
<br>
<br>I would trust Hagrid with my life," said Dumbledore.
<br>
<br>"I'm not saying his heart isn't <b>in</b>  the right place," said Professor
<br>McGonagall grudgingly, "but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does
<br>tend to -- what was that?"
<br>
<br><b>A</b>  low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew
<br>steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of <b>a</b> 
<br>headlight; it swelled to <b>a</b>  roar as they both looked up <b>at</b>  the sky -- and
<br><b>a</b>  huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road <b>in</b>  front of
<br>them.
<br>
<br>If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride
<br>it. He was almost twice as tall as <b>a</b>  normal man and <b>at</b>  least five times
<br>as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long
<br>tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands
<br>the size of trash can lids, and his feet <b>in</b>  their leather boots were
<br>like baby dolphins. <b>In</b>  his vast, muscular arms he was holding <b>a</b>  bundle
<br>of blankets.
<br>
<br>"Hagrid," said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. "<b>At</b>  last. And where did
<br>you get that motorcycle?"
<br>
<br>"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, <b>sit</b> ," said the giant, climbing
<br>carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. "Young Sirius Black lent it to
<br>me. I've got him, sir."
<br>
<br>"No problems, were there?"
<br>
<br>"No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right
<br>before the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was
<br>flyin' over Bristol."
<br>
<br>Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of
<br>blankets. Inside, just visible, was <b>a</b>  baby boy, fast asleep. Under <b>a</b> 
<br>tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see <b>a</b>  curiously
<br>shaped cut, like <b>a</b>  bolt of lightning.
<br>
<br>"Is that where -?" whispered Professor McGonagall.
<br>
<br>"Yes," said Dumbledore. "He'll have that scar forever."
<br>
<br>"Couldn't you <b>do</b>  something about it, Dumbledore?"
<br>
<br>"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come <b>in</b>  handy. I have one myself
<br>above my left knee that is <b>a</b>  perfect map of the London Underground. Well
<br>-- give him here, Hagrid -- we'd better get this over with."
<br>
<br>Dumbledore took Harry <b>in</b>  his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house.
<br>
<br>"Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?" asked Hagrid. He bent his
<br>great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been <b>a</b>  very
<br>scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out <b>a</b>  howl like <b>a</b> 
<br>wounded dog.
<br>
<br>"Shhh!" hissed Professor McGonagall, "you'll wake the Muggles!"
<br>
<br>"S-s-sorry," sobbed Hagrid, taking out <b>a</b>  large, spotted handkerchief and
<br>burying his face <b>in</b>  it. "But I c-c-can't stand it -- Lily an' James dead
<br>-- an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -"
<br>
<br>"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get <b>a</b>  grip on yourself, Hagrid, or
<br>we'll be found," Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly
<br>on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to
<br>the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took <b>a</b>  letter out
<br>of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to
<br>the other two. For <b>a</b>  full minute the three of them stood and looked <b>at</b> 
<br>the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall
<br>blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from
<br>Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.
<br>
<br>"Well," said Dumbledore finally, "that's that. We've no business staying
<br>here. We may as well go and join the celebrations."
<br>
<br>"Yeah," said Hagrid <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  very muffled voice, "I'll be takin' Sirius his
<br>bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir."
<br>
<br>Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself
<br>onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with <b>a</b>  roar it rose
<br>into the air and off into the night.
<br>
<br>"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall," said Dumbledore,
<br>nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose <b>in</b>  reply.
<br>
<br>Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he
<br>stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and
<br>twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet
<br>Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out <b>a</b>  tabby cat slinking
<br>around the corner <b>at</b>  the other end of the street. He could just see the
<br>bundle of blankets on the step of number four.
<br>
<br>"Good luck, Harry," he murmured. He turned on his heel and with <b>a</b>  swish
<br>of his cloak, he was gone.
<br>
<br><b>A</b>  breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and
<br>tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect
<br>astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his
<br>blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside
<br>him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was
<br>famous, not knowing he would be woken <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  few hours' time by Mrs.
<br>Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk
<br>bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and
<br>pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn't know that <b>at</b>  this very
<br>moment, people meeting <b>in</b>  secret all over the country were holding up
<br>their glasses and saying <b>in</b>  hushed voices: "To Harry Potter -- the boy
<br>who lived!"
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER TWO
<br>
<br>THE VANISHING GLASS
<br>
<br>Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find
<br>their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed <b>at</b> 
<br>all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass
<br>number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living
<br>room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when
<br>Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the
<br>photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.
<br>Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like <b>a</b> 
<br>large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley
<br>Dursley was no longer <b>a</b>  baby, and now the photographs showed <b>a</b>  large
<br>blond boy riding his first bicycle, on <b>a</b>  carousel <b>at</b>  the fair, playing <b>a</b> 
<br>computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.
<br>The room held no sign <b>at</b>  all that another boy lived <b>in</b>  the house, too.
<br>
<br>Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep <b>at</b>  the moment, but not for
<br>long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made
<br>the first noise of the day.
<br>
<br>"Up! Get up! Now!"
<br>
<br>Harry woke with <b>a</b>  start. His aunt rapped on the door again.
<br>
<br>"Up!" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then
<br>the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his
<br>back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been <b>a</b> 
<br>good one. There had been <b>a</b>  flying motorcycle <b>in</b>  it. He had <b>a</b>  funny
<br>feeling he'd had the same dream before.
<br>
<br>His aunt was back outside the door.
<br>
<br>"Are you up yet?" she demanded.
<br>
<br>"Nearly," said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Well, get <b>a</b>  move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you
<br>dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday."
<br>
<br>Harry groaned.
<br>
<br>"What did you say?" his aunt snapped through the door.
<br>
<br>"Nothing, nothing..."
<br>
<br>Dudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out
<br>of bed and started looking for socks. He found <b>a</b>  pair under his bed and,
<br>after pulling <b>a</b>  spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to
<br>spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and
<br>that was where he slept.
<br>
<br>When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table
<br>was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as
<br>though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the
<br>second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted <b>a</b> 
<br>racing bike was <b>a</b>  mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated
<br>exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's
<br>favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry
<br>didn't look it, but he was very fast.
<br>
<br>Perhaps it had something to <b>do</b>  with living <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  dark cupboard, but Harry
<br>had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and
<br>skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes
<br>of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry
<br>had <b>a</b>  thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He
<br>wore round glasses held together with <b>a</b>  lot of Scotch tape because of
<br>all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry
<br>liked about his own appearance was <b>a</b>  very thin scar on his forehead that
<br>was shaped like <b>a</b>  bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could
<br>remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt
<br>Petunia was how he had gotten it.
<br>
<br>"<b>In</b>  the car crash when your parents died," she had said. "And don't ask
<br>questions."
<br>
<br>Don't ask questions -- that was the first rule for <b>a</b>  quiet life with the
<br>Dursleys.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.
<br>
<br>"Comb your hair!" he barked, by way of <b>a</b>  morning greeting.
<br>
<br>About once <b>a</b>  week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and
<br>shouted that Harry needed <b>a</b>  haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts
<br>than the rest of the boys <b>in</b>  his class put
<br>
<br>together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way --
<br>all over the place.
<br>
<br>Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived <b>in</b>  the kitchen with his
<br>mother. Dudley looked <b>a</b>  lot like Uncle Vernon. He had <b>a</b>  large pink face,
<br>not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay
<br>smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley
<br>looked like <b>a</b>  baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like <b>a</b> 
<br>pig <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  wig.
<br>
<br>Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult
<br>as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents.
<br>His face fell.
<br>
<br>"Thirty-six," he said, looking up <b>at</b>  his mother and father. "That's two
<br>less than last year."
<br>
<br>"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here
<br>under this big one from Mommy and Daddy."
<br>
<br>"All right, thirty-seven then," said Dudley, going red <b>in</b>  the face.
<br>Harry, who could see <b>a</b>  huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down
<br>his bacon as fast as possible <b>in</b>  case Dudley turned the table over.
<br>
<br>Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,
<br>"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's
<br>that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right''
<br>
<br>Dudley thought for <b>a</b>  moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said
<br>slowly, "So I'll have thirty ... thirty..."
<br>
<br>"Thirty-nine, sweetums," said Aunt Petunia.
<br>
<br>"Oh." Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. "All right
<br>then."
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon chuckled. "Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like
<br>his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!" He ruffled Dudley's hair.
<br>
<br><b>At</b>  that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it
<br>while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, <b>a</b> 
<br>video camera, <b>a</b>  remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and
<br><b>a</b>  VCR. He was ripping the paper off <b>a</b>  gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia
<br>came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.
<br>
<br>"Bad news, Vernon," she said. "Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't
<br>take him." She jerked her head <b>in</b>  Harry's direction.
<br>
<br>Dudley's mouth fell open <b>in</b>  horror, but Harry's heart gave <b>a</b>  leap. Every
<br>year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and <b>a</b>  friend out for the
<br>day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every
<br>year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, <b>a</b>  mad old lady who lived two
<br>streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage
<br>and Mrs. Figg made him look <b>at</b>  photographs of all the cats she'd ever
<br>owned.
<br>
<br>"Now what?" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously <b>at</b>  Harry as though he'd
<br>planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had
<br>broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be
<br><b>a</b>  whole year before he had to look <b>at</b>  Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and
<br>Tufty again.
<br>
<br>"We could phone Marge," Uncle Vernon suggested.
<br>
<br>"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy."
<br>
<br>The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't
<br>there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't
<br>understand them, like <b>a</b>  slug.
<br>
<br>"What about what's-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?"
<br>
<br>"On vacation <b>in</b>  Majorca," snapped Aunt Petunia.
<br>
<br>"You could just leave me here," Harry put <b>in</b>  hopefully (he'd be able to
<br>watch what he wanted on television for <b>a</b>  change and maybe even have <b>a</b>  go
<br>on Dudley's computer).
<br>
<br>Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed <b>a</b>  lemon.
<br>
<br>"And come back and find the house <b>in</b>  ruins?" she snarled.
<br>
<br>"I won't blow up the house," said Harry, but they weren't listening.
<br>
<br>"I suppose we could take him to the zoo," said Aunt Petunia slowly, "...
<br>and leave him <b>in</b>  the car...."
<br>
<br>"That car's new, he's not sitting <b>in</b>  it alone...."
<br>
<br>Dudley began to cry loudly. <b>In</b>  fact, he wasn't really crying -- it had
<br>been years since he'd really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up
<br>his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.
<br>
<br>"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special
<br>day!" she cried, flinging her arms around him.
<br>
<br>"I... don't... want... him... t-t-to come!" Dudley yelled between huge,
<br>pretend sobs. "He always sp- spoils everything!" He shot Harry <b>a</b>  nasty
<br>grin through the gap <b>in</b>  his mother's arms.
<br>
<br>Just then, the doorbell rang -- "Oh, good Lord, they're here!" said Aunt
<br>Petunia frantically -- and <b>a</b>  moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers
<br>Polkiss, walked <b>in</b>  with his mother. Piers was <b>a</b>  scrawny boy with <b>a</b>  face
<br>like <b>a</b>  rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their
<br>backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry <b>at</b>  once.
<br>
<br>Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting <b>in</b> 
<br>the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the
<br>zoo for the first time <b>in</b>  his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able
<br>to think of anything else to <b>do</b>  with him, but before they'd left, Uncle
<br>Vernon had taken Harry aside.
<br>
<br>"I'm warning you," he had said, putting his large purple face right up
<br>close to Harry's, "I'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business,
<br>anything <b>at</b>  all -- and you'll be <b>in</b>  that cupboard from now until
<br>Christmas."
<br>
<br>"I'm not going to <b>do</b>  anything," said Harry, "honestly..
<br>
<br>But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did.
<br>
<br>The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was
<br>just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen.
<br>
<br>Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking
<br>as though he hadn't been <b>at</b>  all, had taken <b>a</b>  pair of kitchen scissors
<br>and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which
<br>she left "to hide that horrible scar." Dudley had laughed himself silly
<br><b>at</b>  Harry, who spent <b>a</b>  sleepless night imagining school the next day,
<br>where he was already laughed <b>at</b>  for his baggy clothes and taped glasses.
<br>Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it
<br>had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given <b>a</b>  week
<br><b>in</b>  his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he
<br>couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.
<br>
<br>Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into <b>a</b>  revolting
<br>old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she
<br>tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until
<br>finally it might have fitted <b>a</b>  hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit
<br>Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk <b>in</b>  the wash and, to
<br>his great relief, Harry wasn't punished.
<br>
<br>On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on
<br>the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as
<br>usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was
<br>sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received <b>a</b>  very angry letter
<br>from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school
<br>buildings. But all he'd tried to <b>do</b>  (as he shouted <b>at</b>  Uncle Vernon
<br>through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash
<br>cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have
<br>caught him <b>in</b>  mid- jump.
<br>
<br>But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with
<br>Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school,
<br>his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room.
<br>
<br>While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to
<br>complain about things: people <b>at</b>  work, Harry, the council, Harry, the
<br>bank, and Harry were just <b>a</b>  few of his favorite subjects. This morning,
<br>it was motorcycles.
<br>
<br>"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums," he said, as <b>a</b> 
<br>motorcycle overtook them.
<br>
<br>I had <b>a</b>  dream about <b>a</b>  motorcycle," said Harry, remembering suddenly. "It
<br>was flying."
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car <b>in</b>  front. He turned right
<br>around <b>in</b>  his seat and yelled <b>at</b>  Harry, his face like <b>a</b>  gigantic beet
<br>with <b>a</b>  mustache: "MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!"
<br>
<br>Dudley and Piers sniggered.
<br>
<br>I know they don't," said Harry. "It was only <b>a</b>  dream."
<br>
<br>But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the
<br>Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking
<br>about anything acting <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  way it shouldn't, no matter if it was <b>in</b>  <b>a</b> 
<br>dream or even <b>a</b>  cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous
<br>ideas.
<br>
<br>It was <b>a</b>  very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The
<br>Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams <b>at</b>  the
<br>entrance and then, because the smiling lady <b>in</b>  the van had asked Harry
<br>what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him <b>a</b>  cheap
<br>lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they
<br>watched <b>a</b>  gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley,
<br>except that it wasn't blond.
<br>
<br>Harry had the best morning he'd had <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  long time. He was careful to
<br>walk <b>a</b>  little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who
<br>were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall
<br>back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate <b>in</b>  the zoo
<br>restaurant, and when Dudley had <b>a</b>  tantrum because his knickerbocker
<br>glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him
<br>another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.
<br>
<br>Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to
<br>last.
<br>
<br>After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark <b>in</b> 
<br>there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts
<br>of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and
<br>stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick,
<br>man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake <b>in</b>  the
<br>place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car
<br>and crushed it into <b>a</b>  trash can -- but <b>at</b>  the moment it didn't look <b>in</b> 
<br>the mood. <b>In</b>  fact, it was fast asleep.
<br>
<br>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring <b>at</b>  the
<br>glistening brown coils.
<br>
<br>"Make it move," he whined <b>at</b>  his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the
<br>glass, but the snake didn't budge.
<br>
<br>"Do it again," Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly
<br>with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.
<br>
<br>"This is boring," Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.
<br>
<br>Harry moved <b>in</b>  front of the tank and looked intently <b>at</b>  the snake. He
<br>wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no
<br>company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying
<br>to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having <b>a</b>  cupboard as <b>a</b> 
<br>bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door
<br>to wake you up; <b>at</b>  least he got to visit the rest of the house.
<br>
<br>The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised
<br>its head until its eyes were on <b>a</b>  level with Harry's.
<br>
<br>It winked.
<br>
<br>Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was
<br>watching. They weren't. He looked back <b>at</b>  the snake and winked, too.
<br>
<br>The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised
<br>its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry <b>a</b>  look that said quite plainly:
<br>
<br>"I get that all the time.
<br>
<br>"I know," Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the
<br>snake could hear him. "It must be really annoying."
<br>
<br>The snake nodded vigorously.
<br>
<br>"Where <b>do</b>  you come from, anyway?" Harry asked.
<br>
<br>The snake jabbed its tail <b>at</b>  <b>a</b>  little sign next to the glass. Harry
<br>peered <b>at</b>  it.
<br>
<br>Boa Constrictor, Brazil.
<br>
<br>"Was it nice there?"
<br>
<br>The boa constrictor jabbed its tail <b>at</b>  the sign again and Harry read on:
<br>This specimen was bred <b>in</b>  the zoo. "Oh, I see -- so you've never been to
<br>Brazil?"
<br>
<br>As the snake shook its head, <b>a</b>  deafening shout behind Harry made both of
<br>them jump.
<br>
<br>"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE
<br>WHAT IT'S DOING!"
<br>
<br>Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.
<br>
<br>"Out of the way, you," he said, punching Harry <b>in</b>  the ribs. Caught by
<br>surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened
<br>so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were
<br>leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with
<br>howls of horror.
<br>
<br>Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank
<br>had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering
<br>out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and
<br>started running for the exits.
<br>
<br>As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn <b>a</b>  low,
<br>hissing voice said, "Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo."
<br>
<br>The keeper of the reptile house was <b>in</b>  shock.
<br>
<br>"But the glass," he kept saying, "where did the glass go?"
<br>
<br>The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia <b>a</b>  cup of strong, sweet tea
<br>while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only
<br>gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except
<br>snap playfully <b>at</b>  their heels as it passed, but by the time they were
<br>all back <b>in</b>  Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had
<br>nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to
<br>squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry <b>at</b>  least, was Piers
<br>calming down enough to say, "Harry was talking to it, weren't you,
<br>Harry?"
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before
<br>starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to
<br>say, "Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals," before he collapsed into <b>a</b> 
<br>chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him <b>a</b>  large brandy.
<br>
<br>Harry lay <b>in</b>  his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had <b>a</b>  watch. He
<br>didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were
<br>asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen
<br>for some food.
<br>
<br>He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as
<br>long as he could remember, ever since he'd been <b>a</b>  baby and his parents
<br>had died <b>in</b>  that car crash. He couldn't remember being <b>in</b>  the car when
<br>his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long
<br>hours <b>in</b>  his cupboard, he came up with <b>a</b>  strange vision: <b>a</b>  blinding
<br>flash of green light and <b>a</b>  burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he
<br>supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green
<br>light came from. He couldn't remember his parents <b>at</b>  all. His aunt and
<br>uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask
<br>questions. There were no photographs of them <b>in</b>  the house.
<br>
<br>When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown
<br>relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the
<br>Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped)
<br>that strangers <b>in</b>  the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers
<br>they were, too. <b>A</b>  tiny man <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  violet top hat had bowed to him once
<br>while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry
<br>furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the
<br>shop without buying anything. <b>A</b>  wild-looking old woman dressed all <b>in</b> 
<br>green had waved merrily <b>at</b>  him once on <b>a</b>  bus. <b>A</b>  bald man <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  very long
<br>purple coat had actually shaken his hand <b>in</b>  the street the other day and
<br>then walked away without <b>a</b>  word. The weirdest thing about all these
<br>people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get <b>a</b> 
<br>closer look.
<br>
<br><b>At</b>  school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated
<br>that odd Harry Potter <b>in</b>  his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and
<br>nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER THREE
<br>
<br>THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE
<br>
<br>The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his
<br>longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard
<br>again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his
<br>new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time
<br>out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet
<br>Drive on her crutches.
<br>
<br>Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang,
<br>who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and
<br>Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and
<br>stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite
<br>happy to join <b>in</b>  Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.
<br>
<br>This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,
<br>wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he
<br>could see <b>a</b>  tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off
<br>to secondary school and, for the first time <b>in</b>  his life, he wouldn't be
<br>with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted <b>at</b>  Uncle Vernon's old private
<br>school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the
<br>other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley
<br>thought this was very funny.
<br>
<br>"They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day <b>at</b>  Stonewall,"
<br>he told Harry. "Want to come upstairs and practice?"
<br>
<br>"No, thanks," said Harry. "The poor toilet's never had anything as
<br>horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick." Then he ran, before
<br>Dudley could work out what he'd said.
<br>
<br>One day <b>in</b>  July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings
<br>uniform, leaving Harry <b>at</b>  Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn 't as bad as
<br>usual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats,
<br>and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch
<br>television and gave him <b>a</b>  bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though
<br>she'd had it for several years.
<br>
<br>That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family <b>in</b> 
<br>his brand-new uniform. Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange
<br>knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried
<br>knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't
<br>looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.
<br>
<br>As he looked <b>at</b>  Dudley <b>in</b>  his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said
<br>gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst
<br>into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he
<br>looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn't trust himself to speak. He
<br>thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to
<br>laugh.
<br>
<br>There was <b>a</b>  horrible smell <b>in</b>  the kitchen the next morning when Harry
<br>went <b>in</b>  for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from <b>a</b>  large metal tub <b>in</b> 
<br>the sink. He went to have <b>a</b>  look. The tub was full of what looked like
<br>dirty rags swimming <b>in</b>  gray water.
<br>
<br>"What's this?" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always
<br>did if he dared to ask <b>a</b>  question.
<br>
<br>"Your new school uniform," she said.
<br>
<br>Harry looked <b>in</b>  the bowl again.
<br>
<br>"Oh," he said, "I didn't realize it had to be so wet."
<br>
<br>"DotA be stupid," snapped Aunt Petunia. "I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old
<br>things gray for you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've
<br>finished."
<br>
<br>Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat
<br>down <b>at</b>  the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look
<br>on his first day <b>at</b>  Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of old
<br>elephant skin, probably.
<br>
<br>Dudley and Uncle Vernon came <b>in</b> , both with wrinkled noses because of the
<br>smell from Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as
<br>usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere,
<br>on the table.
<br>
<br>They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the
<br>doormat.
<br>
<br>"Get the mail, Dudley," said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.
<br>
<br>"Make Harry get it."
<br>
<br>"Get the mail, Harry."
<br>
<br>"Make Dudley get it."
<br>
<br>"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley."
<br>
<br>Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things
<br>lay on the doormat: <b>a</b>  postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was
<br>vacationing on the Isle of Wight, <b>a</b>  brown envelope that looked like <b>a</b> 
<br>bill, and -- <b>a</b>  letter for Harry.
<br>
<br>Harry picked it up and stared <b>at</b>  it, his heart twanging like <b>a</b>  giant
<br>elastic band. No one, ever, <b>in</b>  his whole life, had written to him. Who
<br>would? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the
<br>library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet
<br>here it was, <b>a</b>  letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:
<br>
<br>Mr. H. Potter
<br>
<br>The Cupboard under the Stairs
<br>
<br>4 Privet Drive
<br>
<br>Little Whinging
<br>
<br>Surrey
<br>
<br>The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the
<br>address was written <b>in</b>  emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.
<br>
<br>Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw <b>a</b>  purple wax
<br>seal bearing <b>a</b>  coat of arms; <b>a</b>  lion, an eagle, <b>a</b>  badger, and <b>a</b>  snake
<br>surrounding <b>a</b>  large letter H.
<br>
<br>"Hurry up, boy!" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. "What are you
<br>doing, checking for letter bombs?" He chuckled <b>at</b>  his own joke.
<br>
<br>Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring <b>at</b>  his letter. He handed
<br>Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to
<br>open the yellow envelope.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted <b>in</b>  disgust, and flipped over
<br>the postcard.
<br>
<br>"Marge's ill," he informed Aunt Petunia. "Ate <b>a</b>  funny whelk. --."
<br>
<br>"Dad!" said Dudley suddenly. "Dad, Harry's got something!"
<br>
<br>Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the
<br>same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of
<br>his hand by Uncle Vernon.
<br>
<br>"That's mine!" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.
<br>
<br>"Who'd be writing to you?" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open
<br>with one hand and glancing <b>at</b>  it. His face went from red to green faster
<br>than <b>a</b>  set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds
<br>it was the grayish white of old porridge.
<br>
<br>"P-P-Petunia!" he gasped.
<br>
<br>Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it
<br>high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first
<br>line. For <b>a</b>  moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her
<br>throat and made <b>a</b>  choking noise.
<br>
<br>"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!"
<br>
<br>They stared <b>at</b>  each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and
<br>Dudley were still <b>in</b>  the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He
<br>gave his father <b>a</b>  sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.
<br>
<br>"I want to read that letter," he said loudly. want to read it," said
<br>Harry furiously, "as it's mine."
<br>
<br>"Get out, both of you," croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back
<br>inside its envelope.
<br>
<br>Harry didn't move.
<br>
<br>I WANT MY LETTER!" he shouted.
<br>
<br>"Let me see it!" demanded Dudley.
<br>
<br>"OUT!" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the
<br>scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the
<br>kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had <b>a</b>  furious but
<br>silent fight over who would listen <b>at</b>  the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry,
<br>his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen <b>at</b> 
<br>the crack between door and floor.
<br>
<br>"Vernon," Aunt Petunia was saying <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  quivering voice, "look <b>at</b>  the
<br>address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think
<br>they're watching the house?"
<br>
<br>"Watching -- spying -- might be following us," muttered Uncle Vernon
<br>wildly.
<br>
<br>"But what should we <b>do</b> , Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don't
<br>want --"
<br>
<br>Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the
<br>kitchen.
<br>
<br>"No," he said finally. "No, we'll ignore it. If they don't get an
<br>answer... Yes, that's best... we won't <b>do</b>  anything....
<br>
<br>"But --"
<br>
<br>"I'm not having one <b>in</b>  the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took
<br>him <b>in</b>  we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?"
<br>
<br>That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd
<br>never done before; he visited Harry <b>in</b>  his cupboard.
<br>
<br>"Where's my letter?" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed
<br>through the door. "Who's writing to me?"
<br>
<br>"No one. it was addressed to you by mistake," said Uncle Vernon shortly.
<br>"I have burned it."
<br>
<br>"It was not <b>a</b>  mistake," said Harry angrily, "it had my cupboard on it."
<br>
<br>"SILENCE!" yelled Uncle Vernon, and <b>a</b>  couple of spiders fell from the
<br>ceiling. He took <b>a</b>  few deep breaths and then forced his face into <b>a</b> 
<br>smile, which looked quite painful.
<br>
<br>"Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been
<br>thinking... you're really getting <b>a</b>  bit big for it... we think it might
<br>be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom.
<br>
<br>"Why?" said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Don't ask questions!" snapped his uncle. "Take this stuff upstairs,
<br>now."
<br>
<br>The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt
<br>Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one
<br>where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things
<br>that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip
<br>upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He
<br>sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything <b>in</b>  here was
<br>broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of <b>a</b>  small, working
<br>tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; <b>in</b>  the
<br>corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot
<br>through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was <b>a</b>  large
<br>birdcage, which had once held <b>a</b>  parrot that Dudley had swapped <b>at</b>  school
<br>for <b>a</b>  real air rifle, which was up on <b>a</b>  shelf with the end all bent
<br>because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They
<br>were the only things <b>in</b>  the room that looked as though they'd never been
<br>touched.
<br>
<br>From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling <b>at</b>  his mother, I don't
<br>want him <b>in</b>  there... I need that room... make him get out...."
<br>
<br>Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given
<br>anything to be up here. Today he'd rather be back <b>in</b>  his cupboard with
<br>that letter than up here without it.
<br>
<br>Next morning <b>at</b>  breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was <b>in</b> 
<br>shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been
<br>sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the
<br>greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was
<br>thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the
<br>letter <b>in</b>  the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking <b>at</b>  each
<br>other darkly.
<br>
<br>When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice
<br>to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with
<br>his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, "There's
<br>another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --'"
<br>
<br>With <b>a</b>  strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the
<br>hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the
<br>ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact
<br>that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After <b>a</b> 
<br>minute of confused fighting, <b>in</b>  which everyone got hit <b>a</b>  lot by the
<br>Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with
<br>Harry's letter clutched <b>in</b>  his hand.
<br>
<br>"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom," he wheezed <b>at</b>  Harry.
<br>"Dudley -- go -- just go."
<br>
<br>Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out
<br>of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn't received his first
<br>letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure
<br>they didn't fail. He had <b>a</b>  plan.
<br>
<br>The repaired alarm clock rang <b>at</b>  six o'clock the next morning. Harry
<br>turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the
<br>Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.
<br>
<br>He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and
<br>get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept
<br>across the dark hall toward the front door --
<br>
<br>Harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden on something big and squashy on
<br>the doormat -- something alive!
<br>
<br>Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the
<br>big, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been
<br>lying <b>at</b>  the foot of the front door <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  sleeping bag, clearly making
<br>sure that Harry didn't <b>do</b>  exactly what he'd been trying to <b>do</b> . He
<br>shouted <b>at</b>  Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make
<br><b>a</b>  cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the
<br>time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's lap.
<br>Harry could see three letters addressed <b>in</b>  green ink.
<br>
<br>I want --" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into
<br>pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He
<br>stayed <b>at</b>  home and nailed up the mail slot.
<br>
<br>"See," he explained to Aunt Petunia through <b>a</b>  mouthful of nails, "if
<br>they can't deliver them they'll just give up."
<br>
<br>"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon."
<br>
<br>"Oh, these people's minds work <b>in</b>  strange ways, Petunia, they're not
<br>like you and me," said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  nail with the
<br>piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.
<br>
<br>On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they
<br>couldn't go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door,
<br>slotted through the sides, and <b>a</b>  few even forced through the small
<br>window <b>in</b>  the downstairs bathroom.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon stayed <b>at</b>  home again. After burning all the letters, he got
<br>out <b>a</b>  hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and
<br>back doors so no one could go out. He hummed "Tiptoe Through the Tulips"
<br>as he worked, and jumped <b>at</b>  small noises.
<br>
<br>On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to
<br>Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each
<br>of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt
<br>Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious
<br>telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone
<br>to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters <b>in</b>  her food processor.
<br>
<br>"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?" Dudley asked Harry <b>in</b> 
<br>amazement.
<br>
<br>On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down <b>at</b>  the breakfast table looking
<br>tired and rather ill, but happy.
<br>
<br>"No post on Sundays," he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade
<br>on his newspapers, "no damn letters today --"
<br>
<br>Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught
<br>him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty
<br>letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys
<br>ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one.
<br>
<br>"Out! OUT!"
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.
<br>When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their
<br>faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters
<br>still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.
<br>
<br>"That does it," said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling
<br>great tufts out of his mustache <b>at</b>  the same time. I want you all back
<br>here <b>in</b>  five minutes ready to leave. We're going away. Just pack some
<br>clothes. No arguments!"
<br>
<br>He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared
<br>argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the
<br>boarded-up doors and were <b>in</b>  the car, speeding toward the highway.
<br>Dudley was sniffling <b>in</b>  the back seat; his father had hit him round the
<br>head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and
<br>computer <b>in</b>  his sports bag.
<br>
<br>They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they
<br>were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take <b>a</b>  sharp turn and
<br>drive <b>in</b>  the opposite direction for <b>a</b>  while. "Shake'em off... shake 'em
<br>off," he would mutter whenever he did this.
<br>
<br>They didn't stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was
<br>howling. He'd never had such <b>a</b>  bad day <b>in</b>  his life. He was hungry, he'd
<br>missed five television programs he'd wanted to see, and he'd never gone
<br>so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon stopped <b>at</b>  last outside <b>a</b>  gloomy-looking hotel on the
<br>outskirts of <b>a</b>  big city. Dudley and Harry shared <b>a</b>  room with twin beds
<br>and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on
<br>the windowsill, staring down <b>at</b>  the lights of passing cars and
<br>wondering....
<br>
<br>They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for
<br>breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the
<br>hotel came over to their table.
<br>
<br>"'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an 'undred
<br>of these <b>at</b>  the front desk."
<br>
<br>She held up <b>a</b>  letter so they could read the green ink address:
<br>
<br>Mr. H. Potter
<br>
<br>Room 17
<br>
<br>Railview Hotel
<br>
<br>Cokeworth
<br>
<br>Harry made <b>a</b>  grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out
<br>of the way. The woman stared.
<br>
<br>"I'll take them," said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following
<br>her from the dining room.
<br>
<br>Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?" Aunt Petunia suggested
<br>timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly
<br>what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the
<br>middle of <b>a</b>  forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back <b>in</b> 
<br>the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened <b>in</b>  the middle
<br>of <b>a</b>  plowed field, halfway across <b>a</b>  suspension bridge, and <b>at</b>  the top of
<br><b>a</b>  multilevel parking garage.
<br>
<br>"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that
<br>afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked <b>at</b>  the coast, locked them all inside
<br>the car, and disappeared.
<br>
<br>It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley
<br>sniveled.
<br>
<br>"It's Monday," he told his mother. "The Great Humberto's on tonight. I
<br>want to stay somewhere with <b>a</b>  television. "
<br>
<br>Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you
<br>could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of
<br>television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of
<br>course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys
<br>had given him <b>a</b>  coat hanger and <b>a</b>  pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.
<br>Still, you weren't eleven every day.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying <b>a</b>  long,
<br>thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd
<br>bought.
<br>
<br>"Found the perfect place!" he said. "Come on! Everyone out!"
<br>
<br>It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing <b>at</b>  what
<br>looked like <b>a</b>  large rock way out <b>at</b>  sea. Perched on top of the rock was
<br>the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was
<br>certain, there was no television <b>in</b>  there.
<br>
<br>"Storm forecast for tonight!" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his
<br>hands together. "And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his
<br>boat!"
<br>
<br><b>A</b>  toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with <b>a</b>  rather
<br>wicked grin, <b>at</b>  an old rowboat bobbing <b>in</b>  the iron-gray water below
<br>them.
<br>
<br>"I've already got us some rations," said Uncle Vernon, "so all aboard!"
<br>
<br>It was freezing <b>in</b>  the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their
<br>necks and <b>a</b>  chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like
<br>hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding,
<br>led the way to the broken-down house.
<br>
<br>The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind
<br>whistled through the gaps <b>in</b>  the wooden walls, and the fireplace was
<br>damp and empty. There were only two rooms.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be <b>a</b>  bag of chips each and four
<br>bananas. He tried to start <b>a</b>  fire but the empty chip bags just smoked
<br>and shriveled up.
<br>
<br>"Could <b>do</b>  with some of those letters now, eh?" he said cheerfully.
<br>
<br>He was <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood <b>a</b>  chance
<br>of reaching them here <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  storm to deliver mail. Harry privately
<br>agreed, though the thought didn't cheer him up <b>at</b>  all.
<br>
<br>As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the
<br>high waves splattered the walls of the hut and <b>a</b>  fierce wind rattled the
<br>filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found <b>a</b>  few moldy blankets <b>in</b>  the second
<br>room and made up <b>a</b>  bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle
<br>Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find
<br>the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest,
<br>most ragged blanket.
<br>
<br>The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry
<br>couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable,
<br>his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the
<br>low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of
<br>Dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat
<br>wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven <b>in</b>  ten minutes' time. He lay and
<br>watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would
<br>remember <b>at</b>  all, wondering where the letter writer was now.
<br>
<br>Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the
<br>roof wasn't going to fall <b>in</b> , although he might be warmer if it did.
<br>Four minutes to go. Maybe the house <b>in</b>  Privet Drive would be so full of
<br>letters when they got back that he'd be able to steal one somehow.
<br>
<br>Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like
<br>that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was
<br>the rock crumbling into the sea?
<br>
<br>One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty ... ten...
<br>nine -- maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three... two...
<br>one...
<br>
<br>BOOM.
<br>
<br>The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring <b>at</b>  the
<br>door. Someone was outside, knocking to come <b>in</b> .
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER FOUR
<br>
<br>THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS
<br>
<br>BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. "Where's the cannon?" he
<br>said stupidly.
<br>
<br>There was <b>a</b>  crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the
<br>room. He was holding <b>a</b>  rifle <b>in</b>  his hands -- now they knew what had been
<br><b>in</b>  the long, thin package he had brought with them.
<br>
<br>"Who's there?" he shouted. "I warn you -- I'm armed!"
<br>
<br>There was <b>a</b>  pause. Then --
<br>
<br>SMASH!
<br>
<br>The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and
<br>with <b>a</b>  deafening crash landed flat on the floor.
<br>
<br><b>A</b>  giant of <b>a</b>  man was standing <b>in</b>  the doorway. His face was almost
<br>completely hidden by <b>a</b>  long, shaggy mane of hair and <b>a</b>  wild, tangled
<br>beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles
<br>under all the hair.
<br>
<br>The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just
<br>brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it
<br>easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped <b>a</b> 
<br>little. He turned to look <b>at</b>  them all.
<br>
<br>"Couldn't make us <b>a</b>  cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been an easy
<br>journey..."
<br>
<br>He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.
<br>
<br>"Budge up, yeh great lump," said the stranger.
<br>
<br>Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching,
<br>terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.
<br>
<br>"An' here's Harry!" said the giant.
<br>
<br>Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the
<br>beetle eyes were crinkled <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  smile.
<br>
<br>"Las' time I saw you, you was only <b>a</b>  baby," said the giant. "Yeh look <b>a</b> 
<br>lot like yet dad, but yeh've got yet mom's eyes."
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon made <b>a</b>  funny rasping noise.
<br>
<br>I demand that you leave <b>at</b>  once, <b>sit</b> !" he said. "You are breaking and
<br>entering!"
<br>
<br>"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune," said the giant; he reached over
<br>the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent
<br>it into <b>a</b>  knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it
<br>into <b>a</b>  corner of the room.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like <b>a</b>  mouse being trodden on.
<br>
<br>"Anyway -- Harry," said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, "<b>a</b> 
<br>very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat on
<br>it <b>at</b>  some point, but it'll taste all right."
<br>
<br>From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled <b>a</b>  slightly
<br>squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was <b>a</b> 
<br>large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it <b>in</b> 
<br>green icing.
<br>
<br>Harry looked up <b>at</b>  the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words
<br>got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, "Who are
<br>you?"
<br>
<br>The giant chuckled.
<br>
<br>"True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and
<br>Grounds <b>at</b>  Hogwarts."
<br>
<br>He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm.
<br>
<br>"What about that tea then, eh?" he said, rubbing his hands together.
<br>"I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind."
<br>
<br>His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags <b>in</b>  it and
<br>he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he
<br>was doing but when he drew back <b>a</b>  second later, there was <b>a</b>  roaring fire
<br>there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt
<br>the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into <b>a</b>  hot bath.
<br>
<br>The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and
<br>began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: <b>a</b> 
<br>copper kettle, <b>a</b>  squashy package of sausages, <b>a</b>  poker, <b>a</b>  teapot, several
<br>chipped mugs, and <b>a</b>  bottle of some amber liquid that he took <b>a</b>  swig from
<br>before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and
<br>smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said <b>a</b>  thing while the giant was
<br>working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt
<br>sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted <b>a</b>  little. Uncle Vernon said
<br>sharply, "Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley."
<br>
<br>The giant chuckled darkly.
<br>
<br>"Yet great puddin' of <b>a</b>  son don' need fattenin' anymore, Dursley, don'
<br>worry."
<br>
<br>He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted
<br>anything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off the
<br>giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said,
<br>"I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are."
<br>
<br>The giant took <b>a</b>  gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his
<br>hand.
<br>
<br>"Call me Hagrid," he said, "everyone does. An' like I told yeh, I'm
<br>Keeper of Keys <b>at</b>  Hogwarts -- yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course.
<br>
<br>"Er -- no," said Harry.
<br>
<br>Hagrid looked shocked.
<br>
<br>"Sorry," Harry said quickly.
<br>
<br>"Sony?" barked Hagrid, turning to stare <b>at</b>  the Dursleys, who shrank back
<br>into the shadows. "It' s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren't
<br>gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou'
<br>Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents
<br>learned it all?"
<br>
<br>"All what?" asked Harry.
<br>
<br>"ALL WHAT?" Hagrid thundered. "Now wait jus' one second!"
<br>
<br>He had leapt to his feet. <b>In</b>  his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut.
<br>The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.
<br>
<br>"Do you mean ter tell me," he growled <b>at</b>  the Dursleys, "that this boy --
<br>this boy! -- knows nothin' abou' -- about ANYTHING?"
<br>
<br>Harry thought this was going <b>a</b>  bit far. He had been to school, after
<br>all, and his marks weren't bad.
<br>
<br>"I know some things," he said. "I can, you know, <b>do</b>  math and stuff." But
<br>Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, "About our world, I mean. Your
<br>world. My world. Yer parents' world."
<br>
<br>"What world?"
<br>
<br>Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.
<br>
<br>"DURSLEY!" he boomed.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded
<br>like "Mimblewimble." Hagrid stared wildly <b>at</b>  Harry.
<br>
<br>"But yeh must know about yet mom and dad," he said. "I mean, they're
<br>famous. You're famous."
<br>
<br>"What? My -- my mom and dad weren't famous, were they?"
<br>
<br>"Yeh don' know... yeh don' know..." Hagrid ran his fingers through his
<br>hair, fixing Harry with <b>a</b>  bewildered stare.
<br>
<br>"Yeh don' know what yeh are?" he said finally.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.
<br>
<br>"Stop!" he commanded. "Stop right there, <b>sit</b> ! I forbid you to tell the
<br>boy anything!"
<br>
<br><b>A</b>  braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious
<br>look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled
<br>with rage.
<br>
<br>"You never told him? Never told him what was <b>in</b>  the letter Dumbledore
<br>left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An'
<br>you've kept it from him all these years?"
<br>
<br>"Kept what from me?" said Harry eagerly.
<br>
<br>"STOP! I FORBID YOU!" yelled Uncle Vernon <b>in</b>  panic.
<br>
<br>Aunt Petunia gave <b>a</b>  gasp of horror.
<br>
<br>"Ah, go boil yet heads, both of yeh," said Hagrid. "Harry -- yet <b>a</b> 
<br>wizard."
<br>
<br>There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind
<br>could be heard.
<br>
<br>"-- <b>a</b>  what?" gasped Harry.
<br>
<br>"<b>A</b>  wizard, o' course," said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which
<br>groaned and sank even lower, "an' <b>a</b>  thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once
<br>yeh've been trained up <b>a</b>  bit. With <b>a</b>  mum an' dad like yours, what else
<br>would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter."
<br>
<br>Harry stretched out his hand <b>at</b>  last to take the yellowish envelope,
<br>addressed <b>in</b>  emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock,
<br>The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:
<br>
<br>HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY
<br>
<br>Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
<br>
<br>(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme
<br>Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)
<br>
<br>Dear Mr. Potter,
<br>
<br>We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted <b>at</b>  Hogwarts
<br>School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed <b>a</b>  list of all
<br>necessary books and equipment.
<br>
<br>Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.
<br>Yours sincerely,
<br>
<br>Minerva McGonagall,
<br>
<br>Deputy Headmistress
<br>
<br>Questions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't
<br>decide which to ask first. After <b>a</b>  few minutes he stammered, "What does
<br>it mean, they await my owl?"
<br>
<br>"Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me," said Hagrid, clapping <b>a</b>  hand to
<br>his forehead with enough force to knock over <b>a</b>  cart horse, and from yet
<br>another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- <b>a</b>  real, live,
<br>rather ruffled-looking owl -- <b>a</b>  long quill, and <b>a</b>  roll of parchment.
<br>With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled <b>a</b>  note that Harry could
<br>read upside down:
<br>
<br>Dear Professor Dumbledore,
<br>
<br>Given Harry his letter.
<br>
<br>Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.
<br>
<br>Weather's horrible. Hope you're Well.
<br>
<br>Hagrid
<br>
<br>Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it <b>in</b>  its
<br>beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he
<br>came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the
<br>telephone.
<br>
<br>Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.
<br>
<br>"Where was I?" said Hagrid, but <b>at</b>  that moment, Uncle Vernon, still
<br>ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.
<br>
<br>"He's not going," he said.
<br>
<br>Hagrid grunted.
<br>
<br>"I'd like ter see <b>a</b>  great Muggle like you stop him," he said.
<br>
<br>"<b>A</b>  what?" said Harry, interested.
<br>
<br>"<b>A</b>  Muggle," said Hagrid, "it's what we call nonmagic folk like thern.
<br>An' it's your bad luck you grew up <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  family o' the biggest Muggles I
<br>ever laid eyes on."
<br>
<br>"We swore when we took him <b>in</b>  we'd put <b>a</b>  stop to that rubbish," said
<br>Uncle Vernon, "swore we'd stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!"
<br>
<br>"You knew?" said Harry. "You knew I'm <b>a</b>  -- <b>a</b>  wizard?"
<br>
<br>"Knew!" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. "Knew! Of course we knew! How
<br>could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got <b>a</b> 
<br>letter just like that and disappeared off to that-that school-and came
<br>home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups
<br>into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- <b>a</b>  freak!
<br>But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that,
<br>they were proud of having <b>a</b>  witch <b>in</b>  the family!"
<br>
<br>She stopped to draw <b>a</b>  deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed
<br>she had been wanting to say all this for years.
<br>
<br>"Then she met that Potter <b>at</b>  school and they left and got married and
<br>had you, and of course I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange,
<br>just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went and got
<br>herself blown up and we got landed with you!"
<br>
<br>Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, "Blown
<br>up? You told me they died <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  car crash!"
<br>
<br>"CAR CRASH!" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys
<br>scuttled back to their corner. "How could <b>a</b>  car crash kill Lily an'
<br>James Potter? It's an outrage! <b>A</b>  scandal! Harry Potter not knowin' his
<br>own story when every kid <b>in</b>  our world knows his name!" "But why? What
<br>happened?" Harry asked urgently.
<br>
<br>The anger faded from Hagrid's face. He looked suddenly anxious.
<br>
<br>"I never expected this," he said, <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  low, worried voice. "I had no
<br>idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin' hold of
<br>yeh, how much yeh didn't know. Ah, Harry, I don' know if I'm the right
<br>person ter tell yeh -- but someone 3 s gotta -- yeh can't go off ter
<br>Hogwarts not knowin'."
<br>
<br>He threw <b>a</b>  dirty look <b>at</b>  the Dursleys.
<br>
<br>"Well, it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind, I can't
<br>tell yeh everythin', it's <b>a</b>  great myst'ry, parts of it...."
<br>
<br>He sat down, stared into the fire for <b>a</b>  few seconds, and then said, "It
<br>begins, I suppose, with -- with <b>a</b>  person called -- but it's incredible
<br>yeh don't know his name, everyone <b>in</b>  our world knows --"
<br>
<br>"Who? "
<br>
<br>"Well -- I don' like sayin' the name if I can help it. No one does."
<br>
<br>"Why not?"
<br>
<br>"Gulpin' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is
<br>difficult. See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you
<br>could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was..."
<br>
<br>Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.
<br>
<br>"Could you write it down?" Harry suggested.
<br>
<br>"Nah -can't spell it. All right -- Voldemort. " Hagrid shuddered. "Don'
<br>make me say it again. Anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years
<br>ago now, started lookin' fer followers. Got 'em, too -- some were
<br>afraid, some just wanted <b>a</b>  bit o' his power, 'cause he was gettin'
<br>himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn't know who ter trust,
<br>didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible
<br>things happened. He was takin' over. 'Course, some stood up to him --
<br>an' he killed 'em. Horribly. One o' the only safe places left was
<br>Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of.
<br>Didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway.
<br>
<br>"Now, yer mum an' dad were as good <b>a</b>  witch an' wizard as I ever knew.
<br>Head boy an' girl <b>at</b>  Hogwarts <b>in</b>  their day! Suppose the myst'ry is why
<br>You-Know-Who never tried to get 'em on his side before... probably knew
<br>they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter <b>do</b>  with the
<br>Dark Side.
<br>
<br>"Maybe he thought he could persuade 'em... maybe he just wanted 'em
<br>outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up <b>in</b>  the village where
<br>you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just <b>a</b>  year old.
<br>He came ter yer house an' -- an' --"
<br>
<br>Hagrid suddenly pulled out <b>a</b>  very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew
<br>his nose with <b>a</b>  sound like <b>a</b>  foghorn.
<br>
<br>"Sorry," he said. "But it's that sad -- knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer
<br>people yeh couldn't find -- anyway..."
<br>
<br>"You-Know-Who killed 'em. An' then -- an' this is the real myst'ry of
<br>the thing -- he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make <b>a</b>  clean job of
<br>it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then. But he couldn't
<br><b>do</b>  it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no
<br>ordinary cut. That's what yeh get when <b>a</b>  Powerful, evil curse touches
<br>yeh -- took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even -- but it didn't
<br>work on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after
<br>he decided ter kill 'em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some o' the
<br>best witches an' wizards of the age -- the McKinnons, the Bones, the
<br>Prewetts -- an' you was only <b>a</b>  baby, an' you lived."
<br>
<br>Something very painful was going on <b>in</b>  Harry's mind. As Hagrid's story
<br>came to <b>a</b>  close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more
<br>clearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he remembered
<br>something else, for the first time <b>in</b>  his life: <b>a</b>  high, cold, cruel
<br>laugh.
<br>
<br>Hagrid was watching him sadly.
<br>
<br>"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore's orders. Brought
<br>yeh ter this lot..."
<br>
<br>"Load of old tosh," said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost
<br>forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to
<br>have got back his courage. He was glaring <b>at</b>  Hagrid and his fists were
<br>clenched.
<br>
<br>"Now, you listen here, boy," he snarled, "I accept there's something
<br>strange about you, probably nothing <b>a</b>  good beating wouldn't have cured
<br>-- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no
<br>denying it, and the world's better off without them <b>in</b>  my opinion --
<br>asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types --
<br>just what I expected, always knew they'd come to <b>a</b>  sticky end --"
<br>
<br>But <b>at</b>  that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew <b>a</b>  battered pink
<br>umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this <b>at</b>  Uncle Vernon like <b>a</b> 
<br>sword, he said, "I'm warning you, Dursley -I'm warning you -- one more
<br>word... "
<br>
<br><b>In</b>  danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by <b>a</b>  bearded giant,
<br>Uncle Vernon's courage failed again; he flattened himself against the
<br>wall and fell silent.
<br>
<br>"That's better," said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on
<br>the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.
<br>
<br>Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.
<br>
<br>"But what happened to Vol--, sorry -- I mean, You-Know-Who?"
<br>
<br>"Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter
<br>kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That's the biggest myst'ry, see...
<br>he was gettin' more an' more powerful -- why'd he go?
<br>
<br>"Some say he died. Codswallop, <b>in</b>  my opinion. Dunno if he had enough
<br>human left <b>in</b>  him to die. Some say he's still out there, bidin' his
<br>time, like, but I don' believe it. People who was on his side came back
<br>ter ours. Some of 'em came outta kinda trances. Don~ reckon they
<br>could've done if he was comin' back.
<br>
<br>"Most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers.
<br>Too weak to carry on. 'Cause somethin' about you finished him, Harry.
<br>There was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't counted on -- I dunno
<br>what it was, no one does -- but somethin' about you stumped him, all
<br>right."
<br>
<br>Hagrid looked <b>at</b>  Harry with warmth and respect blazing <b>in</b>  his eyes, but
<br>Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had
<br>been <b>a</b>  horrible mistake. <b>A</b>  wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He'd
<br>spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and
<br>Uncle Vernon; if he was really <b>a</b>  wizard, why hadn't they been turned
<br>into warty toads every time they'd tried to lock him <b>in</b>  his cupboard? If
<br>he'd once defeated the greatest sorcerer <b>in</b>  the world, how come Dudley
<br>had always been able to kick him around like <b>a</b>  football?
<br>
<br>"Hagrid," he said quietly, "I think you must have made <b>a</b>  mistake. I
<br>don't think I can be <b>a</b>  wizard."
<br>
<br>To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.
<br>
<br>"Not <b>a</b>  wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or
<br>angry?"
<br>
<br>Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it... every odd
<br>thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had
<br>happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudley's
<br>gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going
<br>to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow
<br>back... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his
<br>revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn't he set <b>a</b>  boa
<br>constrictor on him?
<br>
<br>Harry looked back <b>at</b>  Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively
<br>beaming <b>at</b>  him.
<br>
<br>"See?" said Hagrid. "Harry Potter, not <b>a</b>  wizard -- you wait, you'll be
<br>right famous <b>at</b>  Hogwarts."
<br>
<br>But Uncle Vernon wasn't going to give <b>in</b>  without <b>a</b>  fight.
<br>
<br>"Haven't I told you he's not going?" he hissed. "He's going to Stonewall
<br>High and he'll be grateful for it. I've read those letters and he needs
<br>all sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and --"
<br>
<br>"If he wants ter go, <b>a</b>  great Muggle like you won't stop him," growled
<br>Hagrid. "Stop Lily an' James Potter' s son goin' ter Hogwarts! Yer mad.
<br>His name's been down ever since he was born. He's off ter the finest
<br>school of witchcraft and wizardry <b>in</b>  the world. Seven years there and he
<br>won't know himself. He'll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer <b>a</b> 
<br>change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had
<br>Albus Dumbled--"
<br>
<br>"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!"
<br>yelled Uncle Vernon.
<br>
<br>But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled
<br>it over his head, "NEVER," he thundered, "- INSULT- ALBUS- DUMBLEDORE-
<br>IN- FRONT- OF- ME!"
<br>
<br>He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point <b>at</b>  Dudley
<br>-- there was <b>a</b>  flash of violet light, <b>a</b>  sound like <b>a</b>  firecracker, <b>a</b> 
<br>sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with
<br>his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling <b>in</b>  pain. When he turned
<br>his back on them, Harry saw <b>a</b>  curly pig's tail poking through <b>a</b>  hole <b>in</b> 
<br>his trousers.
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other
<br>room, he cast one last terrified look <b>at</b>  Hagrid and slammed the door
<br>behind them.
<br>
<br>Hagrid looked down <b>at</b>  his umbrella and stroked his beard.
<br>
<br>"Shouldn'ta lost me temper," he said ruefully, "but it didn't work
<br>anyway. Meant ter turn him into <b>a</b>  pig, but I suppose he was so much like
<br><b>a</b>  pig anyway there wasn't much left ter <b>do</b> ."
<br>
<br>He cast <b>a</b>  sideways look <b>at</b>  Harry under his bushy eyebrows.
<br>
<br>"Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone <b>at</b>  Hogwarts," he
<br>said. "I'm -- er -- not supposed ter <b>do</b>  magic, strictly speakin'. I was
<br>allowed ter <b>do</b>  <b>a</b>  bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff
<br>-- one o' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job
<br>
<br>"Why aren't you supposed to <b>do</b>  magic?" asked Harry.
<br>
<br>"Oh, well -- I was <b>at</b>  Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, ter
<br>tell yeh the truth. <b>In</b>  me third year. They snapped me wand <b>in</b>  half an'
<br>everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man,
<br>Dumbledore." "Why were you expelled?"
<br>
<br>"It's gettin' late and we've got lots ter <b>do</b>  tomorrow," said Hagrid
<br>loudly. "Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that."
<br>
<br>He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.
<br>
<br>"You can kip under that," he said. "Don' mind if it wriggles <b>a</b>  bit, I
<br>think I still got <b>a</b>  couple o' dormice <b>in</b>  one o' the pockets."
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER FIVE
<br>
<br>DIAGON ALLEY
<br>
<br>Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was
<br>daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.
<br>
<br>"It was <b>a</b>  dream, he told himself firmly. "I dreamed <b>a</b>  giant called
<br>Hagrid came to tell me I was going to <b>a</b>  school for wizards. When I open
<br>my eyes I'll be <b>at</b>  home <b>in</b>  my cupboard."
<br>
<br>There was suddenly <b>a</b>  loud tapping noise.
<br>
<br>And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart
<br>sinking. But he still didn't open his eyes. It had been such <b>a</b>  good
<br>dream.
<br>
<br>Tap. Tap. Tap.
<br>
<br>"All right," Harry mumbled, "I'm getting up."
<br>
<br>He sat up and Hagrid's heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of
<br>sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed
<br>sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, <b>a</b>  newspaper
<br>held <b>in</b>  its beak.
<br>
<br>Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though <b>a</b>  large balloon
<br>was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it
<br>open. The owl swooped <b>in</b>  and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who
<br>didn't wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to
<br>attack Hagrid's coat.
<br>
<br>"Don't <b>do</b>  that."
<br>
<br>Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak
<br>fiercely <b>at</b>  him and carried on savaging the coat.
<br>
<br>"Hagrid!" said Harry loudly. "There's an owl
<br>
<br>"Pay him," Hagrid grunted into the sofa.
<br>
<br>"What?"
<br>
<br>"He wants payin' fer deliverin' the paper. Look <b>in</b>  the pockets."
<br>Hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of
<br>keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...
<br>finally, Harry pulled out <b>a</b>  handful of strange-looking coins.
<br>
<br>"Give him five Knuts," said Hagrid sleepily.
<br>
<br>"Knuts?"
<br>
<br>"The little bronze ones."
<br>
<br>Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg
<br>so Harry could put the money into <b>a</b>  small leather pouch tied to it. Then
<br>he flew off through the open window.
<br>
<br>Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.
<br>
<br>"Best be Off, Harry, lots ter <b>do</b>  today, gotta get up ter London an' buy
<br>all yer stuff fer school."
<br>
<br>Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking <b>at</b>  them. He had just
<br>thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon
<br>inside him had got <b>a</b>  puncture.
<br>
<br>"Um -- Hagrid?"
<br>
<br>"Mm?" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.
<br>
<br>"I haven't got any money -- and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ... he
<br>won't pay for me to go and learn magic."
<br>
<br>"Don't worry about that," said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his
<br>head. "D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?"
<br>
<br>"But if their house was destroyed --"
<br>
<br>"They didn' keep their gold <b>in</b>  the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is
<br>Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have <b>a</b>  sausage, they're not bad cold -- an' I
<br>wouldn' say no teh <b>a</b>  bit o' yer birthday cake, neither."
<br>
<br>"Wizards have banks?"
<br>
<br>"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins."
<br>
<br>Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.
<br>
<br>"Goblins?"
<br>
<br>"Yeah -- so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never
<br>mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place <b>in</b>  the world fer
<br>anything yeh want ter keep safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts. As <b>a</b>  matter o'
<br>fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts
<br>business." Hagrid drew himself up proudly. "He usually gets me ter <b>do</b> 
<br>important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you gettin' things from Gringotts --
<br>knows he can trust me, see.
<br>
<br>"Got everythin'? Come on, then."
<br>
<br>Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and
<br>the sea gleamed <b>in</b>  the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was
<br>still there, with <b>a</b>  lot of water <b>in</b>  the bottom after the storm.
<br>
<br>"How did you get here?" Harry asked, looking around for another boat.
<br>"Flew," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>"Flew?"
<br>
<br>"Yeah -- but we'll go back <b>in</b>  this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've
<br>got yeh."
<br>
<br>They settled down <b>in</b>  the boat, Harry still staring <b>at</b>  Hagrid, trying to
<br>imagine him flying.
<br>
<br>"Seems <b>a</b>  shame ter row, though," said Hagrid, giving Harry another of
<br>his sideways looks. "If I was ter -- er -- speed things up <b>a</b>  bit, would
<br>yeh mind not mentionin' it <b>at</b>  Hogwarts?"
<br>
<br>"Of course not," said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out
<br>the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and
<br>they sped off toward land.
<br>
<br>"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?" Harry asked.
<br>
<br>"Spells -- enchantments," said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he
<br>spoke. "They say there's dragons guardin' the highsecurity vaults. And
<br>then yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under
<br>London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter
<br>get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat."
<br>
<br>Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the
<br>Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to
<br>be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never
<br>had so many questions <b>in</b>  his life.
<br>
<br>"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual," Hagrid muttered, turning
<br>the page.
<br>
<br>"There's <b>a</b>  Ministry of Magic?" Harry asked, before he could stop
<br>himself.
<br>
<br>"'Course," said Hagrid. "They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, 0 '
<br>course, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the
<br>job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls
<br>every morning, askin' fer advice."
<br>
<br>"But what does <b>a</b>  Ministry of Magic <b>do</b> ?"
<br>
<br>"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still
<br>witches an' wizards up an' down the country."
<br>
<br>"Why?"
<br>
<br>"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their
<br>problems. Nah, we're best left alone."
<br>
<br><b>At</b>  this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid
<br>folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the
<br>street.
<br>
<br>Passersby stared <b>a</b>  lot <b>at</b>  Hagrid as they walked through the little town
<br>to the station. Harry couldn't blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as
<br>tall as anyone else, he kept pointing <b>at</b>  perfectly ordinary things like
<br>parking meters and saying loudly, "See that, Harry? Things these Muggles
<br>dream up, eh?"
<br>
<br>"Hagrid," said Harry, panting <b>a</b>  bit as he ran to keep up, "did you say
<br>there are dragons <b>at</b>  Gringotts?"
<br>
<br>"Well, so they say," said Hagrid. "Crikey, I'd like <b>a</b>  dragon."
<br>
<br>"You'd like one?"
<br>
<br>"Wanted one ever since I was <b>a</b>  kid -- here we go."
<br>
<br>They had reached the station. There was <b>a</b>  train to London <b>in</b>  five
<br>minutes' time. Hagrid, who didn't understand "Muggle money," as he
<br>called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.
<br>
<br>People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and
<br>sat knitting what looked like <b>a</b>  canary-yellow circus tent.
<br>
<br>"Still got yer letter, Harry?" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry
<br>took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.
<br>
<br>"Good," said Hagrid. "There's <b>a</b>  list there of everything yeh need."
<br>
<br>Harry unfolded <b>a</b>  second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night
<br>before, and read:

<br>
<br>"Can we buy all this <b>in</b>  London?" Harry wondered aloud.
<br>
<br>"If yeh know where to go," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know
<br>where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there <b>in</b>  an
<br>ordinary way. He got stuck <b>in</b>  the ticket barrier on the Underground, and
<br>complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.
<br>
<br>"I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic," he said as they
<br>climbed <b>a</b>  broken-down escalator that led up to <b>a</b>  bustling road lined
<br>with shops.
<br>
<br>Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to <b>do</b> 
<br>was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores,
<br>hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it
<br>could sell you <b>a</b>  magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of
<br>ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles
<br>beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and
<br>broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had
<br>cooked up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of
<br>humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything
<br>Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help
<br>trusting him.
<br>
<br>"This is it," said Hagrid, coming to <b>a</b>  halt, "the Leaky Cauldron. It's <b>a</b> 
<br>famous place."
<br>
<br>It was <b>a</b>  tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out,
<br>Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn't
<br>glance <b>at</b>  it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the
<br>record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron <b>at</b> 
<br>all. <b>In</b>  fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and
<br>Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered
<br>him inside.
<br>
<br>For <b>a</b>  famous place, it was very dark and shabby. <b>A</b>  few old women were
<br>sitting <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was
<br>smoking <b>a</b>  long pipe. <b>A</b>  little man <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  top hat was talking to the old
<br>bartender, who was quite bald and looked like <b>a</b>  toothless walnut. The
<br>low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked <b>in</b> . Everyone seemed to know
<br>Hagrid; they waved and smiled <b>at</b>  him, and the bartender reached for <b>a</b> 
<br>glass, saying, "The usual, Hagrid?"
<br>
<br>"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business," said Hagrid, clapping his great
<br>hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.
<br>
<br>
<br>"Good Lord," said the bartender, peering <b>at</b>  Harry, "is this -- can this
<br>be --?"
<br>
<br>
<br>The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.
<br>
<br>"Bless my soul," whispered the old bartender, "Harry Potter... what an
<br>honor."
<br>
<br>He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his
<br>hand, tears <b>in</b>  his eyes.
<br>
<br>"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back."
<br>
<br>Harry didn't know what to say. Everyone was looking <b>at</b>  him. The old
<br>woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out.
<br>Hagrid was beaming.
<br>
<br>Then there was <b>a</b>  great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry
<br>found himself shaking hands with everyone <b>in</b>  the Leaky Cauldron.
<br>
<br>"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you <b>at</b>  last."
<br>
<br>"So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud."
<br>
<br>"Always wanted to shake your hand -- I'm all of <b>a</b>  flutter."
<br>
<br>"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus
<br>Diggle."
<br>
<br>"I've seen you before!" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off
<br><b>in</b>  his excitement. "You bowed to me once <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  shop."
<br>
<br>"He remembers!" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around <b>at</b>  everyone. "Did
<br>you hear that? He remembers me!" Harry shook hands again and again --
<br>Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.
<br>
<br><b>A</b>  pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes
<br>was twitching.
<br>
<br>"Professor Quirrell!" said Hagrid. "Harry, Professor Quirrell will be
<br>one of your teachers <b>at</b>  Hogwarts."
<br>
<br>"P-P-Potter," stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand,
<br>"c-can't t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you."
<br>
<br>"What sort of magic <b>do</b>  you teach, Professor Quirrell?"
<br>
<br>"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts," muttered Professor Quirrell, as
<br>though he'd rather not think about it. "N-not that you n-need it, eh,
<br>P-P-Potter?" He laughed nervously. "You'll be g-getting all your
<br>equipment, I suppose? I've g-got to p-pick up <b>a</b>  new b-book on vampires,
<br>m-myself." He looked terrified <b>at</b>  the very thought.
<br>
<br>But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It
<br>took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. <b>At</b>  last, Hagrid
<br>managed to make himself heard over the babble.
<br>
<br>"Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry."
<br>
<br>Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them
<br>through the bar and out into <b>a</b>  small, walled courtyard, where there was
<br>nothing but <b>a</b>  trash can and <b>a</b>  few weeds.
<br>
<br>Hagrid grinned <b>at</b>  Harry.
<br>
<br>"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell
<br>was tremblin' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he's usually tremblin'."
<br>
<br>"Is he always that nervous?"
<br>
<br>"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was
<br>
<br>studyin' outta books but then he took <b>a</b>  year off ter get some firsthand
<br>experience.... They say he met vampires <b>in</b>  the Black Forest, and there
<br>was <b>a</b>  nasty bit o' trouble with <b>a</b>  hag -- never been the same since.
<br>Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where's me
<br>umbrella?"
<br>
<br>Vampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was
<br>counting bricks <b>in</b>  the wall above the trash can.
<br>
<br>"Three up... two across he muttered. "Right, stand back, Harry."
<br>
<br>He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.
<br>
<br>The brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- <b>in</b>  the middle, <b>a</b> 
<br>small hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- <b>a</b>  second later they
<br>were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto <b>a</b> 
<br>cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.
<br>
<br>"Welcome," said Hagrid, "to Diagon Alley."
<br>
<br>He grinned <b>at</b>  Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry
<br>looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly
<br>back into solid wall.
<br>
<br>The sun shone brightly on <b>a</b>  stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.
<br>Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring
<br>-- Collapsible, said <b>a</b>  sign hanging over them.
<br>
<br>"Yeah, you'll be needin' one," said Hagrid, "but we gotta get yer money
<br>first."
<br>
<br>Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head <b>in</b>  every
<br>direction as they walked up the street, trying to look <b>at</b>  everything <b>at</b> 
<br>once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their
<br>shopping. <b>A</b>  plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as
<br>they passed, saying, "Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're
<br>mad...."
<br>
<br><b>A</b>  low, soft hooting came from <b>a</b>  dark shop with <b>a</b>  sign saying Eeylops Owl
<br>Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of
<br>about Harry's age had their noses pressed against <b>a</b>  window with
<br>broomsticks <b>in</b>  it. "Look," Harry heard one of them say, "the new Nimbus
<br>Two Thousand -- fastest ever --" There were shops selling robes, shops
<br>selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen
<br>before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes,
<br>tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion
<br>bottles, globes of the moon....
<br>
<br>"Gringotts," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>They had reached <b>a</b>  snowy white building that towered over the other
<br>little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing <b>a</b> 
<br>uniform of scarlet and gold, was -
<br>
<br>"Yeah, that's <b>a</b>  goblin," said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white
<br>stone steps toward him. The goblin was about <b>a</b>  head shorter than Harry.
<br>He had <b>a</b>  swarthy, clever face, <b>a</b>  pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very
<br>long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were
<br>facing <b>a</b>  second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved
<br>upon them:
<br>
<br>Enter, stranger, but take heed
<br>
<br>Of what awaits the sin of greed,
<br>
<br>For those who take, but <b>do</b>  not earn,
<br>
<br>Must pay most dearly <b>in</b>  their turn.
<br>
<br>So if you seek beneath our floors
<br>
<br><b>A</b>  treasure that was never yours,
<br>
<br>Thief, you have been warned, beware
<br>
<br>Of finding more than treasure there.
<br>
<br>"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br><b>A</b>  pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were <b>in</b>  <b>a</b> 
<br>vast marble hall. About <b>a</b>  hundred more goblins were sitting on high
<br>stools behind <b>a</b>  long counter, scribbling <b>in</b>  large ledgers, weighing
<br>coins <b>in</b>  brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses.
<br>There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more
<br>goblins were showing people <b>in</b>  and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made
<br>for the counter.
<br>
<br>"Morning," said Hagrid to <b>a</b>  free goblin. "We've come ter take some money
<br>outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe."
<br>
<br>"You have his key, Sir?"
<br>
<br>"Got it here somewhere," said Hagrid, and he started emptying his
<br>pockets onto the counter, scattering <b>a</b>  handful of moldy dog biscuits
<br>over the goblin's book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry
<br>watched the goblin on their right weighing <b>a</b>  pile of rubies as big as
<br>glowing coals.
<br>
<br>"Got it," said Hagrid <b>at</b>  last, holding up <b>a</b>  tiny golden key.
<br>
<br>The goblin looked <b>at</b>  it closely.
<br>
<br>"That seems to be <b>in</b>  order."
<br>
<br>"An' I've also got <b>a</b>  letter here from Professor Dumbledore," said Hagrid
<br>importantly, throwing out his chest. "It's about the YouKnow-What <b>in</b> 
<br>vault seven hundred and thirteen."
<br>
<br>The goblin read the letter carefully.
<br>
<br>"Very well," he said, handing it back to Hagrid, "I will have Someone
<br>take you down to both vaults. Griphook!"
<br>
<br>Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog
<br>biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward
<br>one of the doors leading off the hall.
<br>
<br>"What's the You-Know-What <b>in</b>  vault seven hundred and thirteen?" Harry
<br>asked.
<br>
<br>"Can't tell yeh that," said Hagrid mysteriously. "Very secret. Hogwarts
<br>business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh
<br>that."
<br>
<br>Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more
<br>marble, was surprised. They were <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  narrow stone passageway lit with
<br>flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little
<br>railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and <b>a</b>  small cart came
<br>hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed <b>in</b>  -- Hagrid with some
<br>difficulty -- and were off.
<br>
<br><b>At</b>  first they just hurtled through <b>a</b>  maze of twisting passages. Harry
<br>tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left,
<br>but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way,
<br>because Griphook wasn't steering.
<br>
<br>Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them
<br>wide open. Once, he thought he saw <b>a</b>  burst of fire <b>at</b>  the end of <b>a</b> 
<br>passage and twisted around to see if it was <b>a</b>  dragon, but too late - -
<br>they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge
<br>stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.
<br>
<br>I never know," Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart,
<br>"what's the difference between <b>a</b>  stalagmite and <b>a</b>  stalactite?"
<br>
<br>"Stalagmite's got an 'm' <b>in</b>  it," said Hagrid. "An' don' ask me questions
<br>just now, I think I'm gonna be sick."
<br>
<br>He did look very green, and when the cart stopped <b>at</b>  last beside <b>a</b>  small
<br>door <b>in</b>  the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the
<br>wall to stop his knees from trembling.
<br>
<br>Griphook unlocked the door. <b>A</b>  lot of green smoke came billowing out, and
<br>as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns
<br>of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.
<br>
<br>"All yours," smiled Hagrid.
<br>
<br>All Harry's -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known about
<br>this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had
<br>they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there
<br>had been <b>a</b>  small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.
<br>
<br>Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into <b>a</b>  bag.
<br>
<br>"The gold ones are Galleons," he explained. "Seventeen silver Sickles to
<br><b>a</b>  Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to <b>a</b>  Sickle, it's easy enough. Right,
<br>that should be enough fer <b>a</b>  couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe
<br>for yeh." He turned to Griphook. "Vault seven hundred and thirteen now,
<br>please, and can we go more slowly?"
<br>
<br>"One speed only," said Griphook.
<br>
<br>They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became
<br>colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went
<br>rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to
<br>try to see what was down <b>at</b>  the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and
<br>pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.
<br>
<br>Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.
<br>
<br>"Stand back," said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with
<br>one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.
<br>
<br>"If anyone but <b>a</b>  Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through
<br>the door and trapped <b>in</b>  there," said Griphook.
<br>
<br>"How often <b>do</b>  you check to see if anyone's inside?" Harry asked.
<br>
<br>"About once every ten years," said Griphook with <b>a</b>  rather nasty grin.
<br>
<br>Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,
<br>Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous
<br>jewels <b>at</b>  the very least -- but <b>at</b>  first he thought it was empty. Then
<br>he noticed <b>a</b>  grubby little package wrapped up <b>in</b>  brown paper lying on
<br>the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry
<br>longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.
<br>
<br>"Come on, back <b>in</b>  this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way
<br>back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>One wild cart ride later they stood blinking <b>in</b>  the sunlight outside
<br>Gringotts. Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had <b>a</b>  bag
<br>full of money. He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to <b>a</b> 
<br>pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had <b>in</b>  his whole
<br>life -- more money than even Dudley had ever had.
<br>
<br>"Might as well get yer uniform," said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam
<br>Malkin's Robes for All Occasions. "Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I
<br>slipped off fer <b>a</b>  pick-me-up <b>in</b>  the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them
<br>Gringotts carts." He did still look <b>a</b>  bit sick, so Harry entered Madam
<br>Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous.
<br>
<br>Madam Malkin was <b>a</b>  squat, smiling witch dressed all <b>in</b>  mauve.
<br>
<br>"Hogwarts, clear?" she said, when Harry started to speak. "Got the lot
<br>here -- another young man being fitted up just now, <b>in</b>  fact. "
<br>
<br><b>In</b>  the back of the shop, <b>a</b>  boy with <b>a</b>  pale, pointed face was standing on
<br><b>a</b>  footstool while <b>a</b>  second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam
<br>Malkin stood Harry on <b>a</b>  stool next to him) slipped <b>a</b>  long robe over his
<br>head, and began to pin it to the right length.
<br>
<br>"Hello," said the boy, "Hogwarts, too?"
<br>
<br>"Yes," said Harry.
<br>
<br>"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street
<br>looking <b>at</b>  wands," said the boy. He had <b>a</b>  bored, drawling voice. "Then
<br>I'm going to drag them off to took <b>at</b>  racing brooms. I don't see why
<br>first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting
<br>me one and I'll smuggle it <b>in</b>  somehow."
<br>
<br>Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.
<br>
<br>"Have you got your own broom?" the boy went on.
<br>
<br>"No," said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Play Quidditch <b>at</b>  all?"
<br>
<br>"No," Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.
<br>
<br>"I <b>do</b>  -- Father says it's <b>a</b>  crime if I'm not picked to play for my
<br>house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be <b>in</b>  yet?"
<br>
<br>"No," said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.
<br>
<br>"Well, no one really knows until they get there, <b>do</b>  they, but I know
<br>I'll be <b>in</b>  Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being <b>in</b> 
<br>Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?" "Mmm," said Harry, wishing
<br>he could say something <b>a</b>  bit more interesting.
<br>
<br>"I say, look <b>at</b>  that man!" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the
<br>front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning <b>at</b>  Harry and pointing
<br><b>at</b>  two large ice creams to show he couldn't come <b>in</b> .
<br>
<br>"That's Hagrid," said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't.
<br>"He works <b>at</b>  Hogwarts."
<br>
<br>"Oh," said the boy, "I've heard of him. He's <b>a</b>  sort of servant, isn't
<br>he?"
<br>
<br>"He's the gamekeeper," said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less
<br>every second.
<br>
<br>"Yes, exactly. I heard he's <b>a</b>  sort of savage -- lives <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  hut on the
<br>school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to <b>do</b>  magic,
<br>and ends up setting fire to his bed."
<br>
<br>"I think he's brilliant," said Harry coldly.
<br>
<br>"Do you?" said the boy, with <b>a</b>  slight sneer. "Why is he with you? Where
<br>are your parents?"
<br>
<br>"They're dead," said Harry shortly. He didn't feel much like going into
<br>the matter with this boy.
<br>
<br>"Oh, sorry," said the other,. not sounding sorry <b>at</b>  all. "But they were
<br>our kind, weren't they?"
<br>
<br>"They were <b>a</b>  witch and wizard, if that's what you mean."
<br>
<br>"I really don't think they should let the other sort <b>in</b> , <b>do</b>  you? They're
<br>just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some
<br>of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter,
<br>imagine. I think they should keep it <b>in</b>  the old wizarding families.
<br>What's your surname, anyway?"
<br>
<br>But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, "That's you done, my
<br>dear," and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy,
<br>hopped down from the footstool.
<br>
<br>"Well, I'll see you <b>at</b>  Hogwarts, I suppose," said the drawling boy.
<br>
<br>Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him
<br>(chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).
<br>
<br>"What's up?" said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>"Nothing," Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry
<br>cheered up <b>a</b>  bit when he found <b>a</b>  bottle of ink that changed color as you
<br>wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, "Hagrid, what's Quidditch?"
<br>
<br>"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know -- not knowin'
<br>about Quidditch!"
<br>
<br>"Don't make me feel worse," said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate
<br>boy <b>in</b>  Madam Malkin's.
<br>
<br>"--and he said people from Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed
<br><b>in</b> ."
<br>
<br>"Yer not from <b>a</b>  Muggle family. If he'd known who yeh were -- he's grown
<br>up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk. You saw what
<br>everyone <b>in</b>  the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what
<br>does he know about it, some o' the best I ever saw were the only ones
<br>with magic <b>in</b>  'em <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  long line 0' Muggles -- look <b>at</b>  yer mum! Look
<br>what she had fer <b>a</b>  sister!"
<br>
<br>"So what is Quidditch?"
<br>
<br>"It's our sport. Wizard sport. It's like -- like soccer <b>in</b>  the Muggle
<br>world -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up <b>in</b>  the air on
<br>broomsticks and there's four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules."
<br>"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?"
<br>
<br>"School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are <b>a</b>  lot o'
<br>duffers, but --"
<br>
<br>"I bet I'm <b>in</b>  Hufflepuff" said Harry gloomily.
<br>
<br>"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin," said Hagrid darkly. "There's not <b>a</b> 
<br>single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't <b>in</b>  Slytherin.
<br>You-Know-Who was one."
<br>
<br>"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was <b>at</b>  Hogwarts?"
<br>
<br>"Years an' years ago," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>They bought Harry's school books <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  shop called Flourish and Blotts
<br>where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as
<br>paving stones bound <b>in</b>  leather; books the size of postage stamps <b>in</b> 
<br>covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and <b>a</b>  few books with
<br>nothing <b>in</b>  them <b>at</b>  all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have
<br>been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag
<br>Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and
<br>Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs,
<br>Tongue- Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
<br>
<br>"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley."
<br>
<br>"I'm not sayin' that's not <b>a</b>  good idea, but yer not ter use magic <b>in</b>  the
<br>Muggle world except <b>in</b>  very special circumstances," said Hagrid. "An'
<br>anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need <b>a</b>  lot more
<br>study before yeh get ter that level."
<br>
<br>Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy <b>a</b>  solid gold cauldron, either ("It says
<br>pewter on yer list"), but they got <b>a</b>  nice set of scales for weighing
<br>potion ingredients and <b>a</b>  collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited
<br>the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible
<br>smell, <b>a</b>  mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff
<br>stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined
<br>the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung
<br>from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for <b>a</b> 
<br>supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself
<br>examined silver unicorn horns <b>at</b>  twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule,
<br>glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts <b>a</b>  scoop).
<br>
<br>Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again.
<br>
<br>"Just yer wand left - <b>A</b>  yeah, an' I still haven't got yeh <b>a</b>  birthday
<br>present."
<br>
<br>Harry felt himself go red.
<br>
<br>"You don't have to --"
<br>
<br>"I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not <b>a</b>  toad,
<br>toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed <b>at</b>  - an' I don'
<br>like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All the kids want
<br>owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'."
<br>
<br>Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been
<br>dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now
<br>carried <b>a</b>  large cage that held <b>a</b>  beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with
<br>her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks,
<br>sounding just like Professor Quirrell.
<br>
<br>"Don' mention it," said Hagrid gruffly. "Don' expect you've had <b>a</b>  lotta
<br>presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer
<br>wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand."
<br>
<br><b>A</b>  magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.
<br>
<br>The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door
<br>read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. <b>A</b>  single wand lay
<br>on <b>a</b>  faded purple cushion <b>in</b>  the dusty window.
<br>
<br><b>A</b>  tinkling bell rang somewhere <b>in</b>  the depths of the shop as they stepped
<br>inside. It was <b>a</b>  tiny place, empty except for <b>a</b>  single, spindly chair
<br>that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had
<br>entered <b>a</b>  very strict library; he swallowed <b>a</b>  lot of new questions that
<br>had just occurred to him and looked instead <b>at</b>  the thousands of narrow
<br>boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of
<br>his neck prickled. The very dust and silence <b>in</b>  here seemed to tingle
<br>with some secret magic.
<br>
<br>"Good afternoon," said <b>a</b>  soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have
<br>jumped, too, because there was <b>a</b>  loud crunching noise and he got quickly
<br>off the spindly chair.
<br>
<br>An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like
<br>moons through the gloom of the shop.
<br>
<br>"Hello," said Harry awkwardly.
<br>
<br>"Ah yes," said the man. "Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon.
<br>Harry Potter." It wasn't <b>a</b>  question. "You have your mother's eyes. It
<br>seems only yesterday she was <b>in</b>  here herself, buying her first wand. Ten
<br>and <b>a</b>  quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm
<br>work."
<br>
<br>Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those
<br>silvery eyes were <b>a</b>  bit creepy.
<br>
<br>"Your father, on the other hand, favored <b>a</b>  mahogany wand. Eleven inches.
<br>Pliable. <b>A</b>  little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I
<br>say your father favored it -- it's really the wand that chooses the
<br>wizard, of course."
<br>
<br>Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to
<br>nose. Harry could see himself reflected <b>in</b>  those misty eyes.
<br>
<br>"And that's where..."
<br>
<br>Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with <b>a</b> 
<br>long, white finger.
<br>
<br>"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it," he said softly.
<br>"Thirteen-and-<b>a</b> -half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and <b>in</b> 
<br>the wrong hands... well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into
<br>the world to <b>do</b> ...."
<br>
<br>He shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid.
<br>
<br>"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen
<br>inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?"
<br>
<br>"It was, sir, yes," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it <b>in</b>  half when you got
<br>expelled?" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.
<br>
<br>"Er -- yes, they did, yes," said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. "I've still
<br>got the pieces, though," he added brightly.
<br>
<br>"But you don't use them?" said Mr. Ollivander sharply.
<br>
<br>"Oh, no, <b>sit</b> ," said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink
<br>umbrella very tightly as he spoke.
<br>
<br>"Hmmm," said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid <b>a</b>  piercing look. "Well, now
<br>-- Mr. Potter. Let me see." He pulled <b>a</b>  long tape measure with silver
<br>markings out of his pocket. "Which is your wand arm?"
<br>
<br>"Er -- well, I'm right-handed," said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Hold out your arm. That's it." He measured Harry from shoulder to
<br>finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round
<br>his head. As he measured, he said, "Every Ollivander wand has <b>a</b>  core of
<br><b>a</b>  powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix
<br>tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands
<br>are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite
<br>the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with
<br>another wizard's wand."
<br>
<br>Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring
<br>between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was
<br>flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.
<br>
<br>"That will <b>do</b> ," he said, and the tape measure crumpled into <b>a</b>  heap on
<br>the floor. "Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon
<br>heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it <b>a</b> 
<br>wave."
<br>
<br>Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around <b>a</b>  bit, but Mr.
<br>Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost <b>at</b>  once.
<br>
<br>"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try --"
<br>
<br>Harry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was
<br>snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.
<br>
<br>"No, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and <b>a</b>  half inches, springy.
<br>Go on, go on, try it out."
<br>
<br>Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting
<br>for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the
<br>spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the
<br>shelves, the happier he seemed to become.
<br>
<br>"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here
<br>somewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination --
<br>holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple."
<br>
<br>Harry took the wand. He felt <b>a</b>  sudden warmth <b>in</b>  his fingers. He raised
<br>the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air
<br>and <b>a</b>  stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like <b>a</b>  firework,
<br>throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and
<br>clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, "Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very
<br>good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... "
<br>
<br>He put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it <b>in</b>  brown paper,
<br>still muttering, "Curious... curious..
<br>
<br>"Sorry," said Harry, "but what's curious?"
<br>
<br>Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.
<br>
<br>"I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It
<br>so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is <b>in</b>  your wand, gave
<br>another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you
<br>should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave
<br>you that scar."
<br>
<br>Harry swallowed.
<br>
<br>"Yes, thirteen-and-<b>a</b> -half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things
<br>happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we must expect
<br>great things from you, Mr. Potter.... After all, He-
<br>Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great."
<br>
<br>Harry shivered. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid
<br>seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his
<br>shop.
<br>
<br>The late afternoon sun hung low <b>in</b>  the sky as Harry and Hagrid made
<br>their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through
<br>the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn't speak <b>at</b>  all as they walked
<br>down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking <b>at</b> 
<br>them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped
<br>packages, with the snowy owl asleep <b>in</b>  its cage on Harry's lap. Up
<br>another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized
<br>where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.
<br>
<br>"Got time fer <b>a</b>  bite to eat before yer train leaves," he said.
<br>
<br>He bought Harry <b>a</b>  hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat
<br>them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.
<br>
<br>"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet," said Hagrid.
<br>
<br>Harry wasn't sure he could explain. He'd just had the best birthday of
<br>his life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the
<br>words.
<br>
<br>"Everyone thinks I'm special," he said <b>at</b>  last. "All those people <b>in</b>  the
<br>Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don't know
<br>anything about magic <b>at</b>  all. How can they expect great things? I'm
<br>famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for. I don't know what
<br>happened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died."
<br>
<br>Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he
<br>wore <b>a</b>  very kind smile.
<br>
<br>"Don' you worry, Harry. You'll learn fast enough. Everyone starts <b>at</b>  the
<br>beginning <b>at</b>  Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. just be yerself. I know it's
<br>hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have <b>a</b> 
<br>great time <b>at</b>  Hogwarts -- I did -- still <b>do</b> , 'smatter of fact."
<br>
<br>Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the
<br>Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.
<br>
<br>"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, " he said. "First o' September -- King's Cross
<br>-- it's all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me <b>a</b> 
<br>letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... See yeh soon,
<br>Harry."
<br>
<br>The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until
<br>he was out of sight; he rose <b>in</b>  his seat and pressed his nose against
<br>the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAPTER SIX
<br>
<br>THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS
<br>
<br>Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so
<br>scared of Harry he wouldn't stay <b>in</b>  the same room, while Aunt Petunia
<br>and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry <b>in</b>  his cupboard, force him to <b>do</b> 
<br>anything, or shout <b>at</b>  him -- <b>in</b>  fact, they didn't speak to him <b>at</b>  all.
<br>Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry
<br><b>in</b>  it were empty. Although this was an improvement <b>in</b>  many ways, it did
<br>become <b>a</b>  bit depressing after <b>a</b>  while.
<br>
<br>Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to
<br>call her Hedwig, <b>a</b>  name he had found <b>in</b>  <b>A</b>  History of Magic. His school
<br>books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the
<br>night, Hedwig swooping <b>in</b>  and out of the open window as she pleased. It
<br>was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come <b>in</b>  to vacuum anymore, because
<br>Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to
<br>sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned
<br>to the wall, counting down to September the first.
<br>
<br>On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and
<br>uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went
<br>down to the living room where they were watching <b>a</b>  quiz show on
<br>television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and
<br>Dudley screamed and ran from the room.
<br>
<br>"Er -- Uncle Vernon?"
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.
<br>
<br>"Er -- I need to be <b>at</b>  King's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts."
<br>
<br>Uncle Vernon grunted again.
<br>
<br>"Would it be all right if you gave me <b>a</b>  lift?"
<br>
<br>Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.
<br>
<br>"Thank you."
<br>
<br>He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.
<br>
<br>"Funny way to get to <b>a</b>  wizards' school, the train. Magic carpets all got
<br>punctures, have they?"
<br>
<br>Harry didn't say anything.
<br>
<br>"Where is this school, anyway?"
<br>
<br>"I don't know," said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled
<br>the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.
<br>
<br>"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters <b>at</b>  eleven
<br>o'clock," he read.
<br>
<br>His aunt and uncle stared.
<br>
<br>"Platform what?"
<br>
<br>"Nine and three-quarters."
<br>
<br>"Don't talk rubbish," said Uncle Vernon. "There is no platform nine and
<br>three-quarters."
<br>
<br>"It's on my ticket."
<br>
<br>"Barking," said Uncle Vernon, "howling mad, the lot of them. You'll see.
<br>You just wait. All right, we'll take you to King's Cross. We're going up
<br>to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother."
<br>
<br>"Why are you going to London?" Harry asked, trying to keep things
<br>friendly.
<br>
<br>"Taking Dudley to the hospital," growled Uncle Vernon. "Got to have that
<br>ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings."
<br>
<br>Harry woke <b>at</b>  five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and
<br>nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because
<br>he didn't want to walk into the station <b>in</b>  his wizard's robes -- he'd
<br>change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure
<br>he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely <b>in</b>  her
<br>cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two
<br>hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the
<br>Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to
<br>Harry, and they had set off.
<br>
<br>They reached King's Cross <b>at</b>  half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's
<br>trunk onto <b>a</b>  cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought
<br>this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the
<br>platforms with <b>a</b>  nasty grin on his face.
<br>
<br>"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform
<br>should be somewhere <b>in</b>  the middle, but they don't seem to have built it
<br>yet, <b>do</b>  they?"
<br>
<br>He was quite right, of course. There was <b>a</b>  big plastic number nine over
<br>one platform and <b>a</b>  big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and
<br><b>in</b>  the middle, nothing <b>at</b>  all.
<br>
<br>"Have <b>a</b>  good term," said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He
<br>left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away.
<br>All three of them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What on
<br>earth was he going to <b>do</b> ? He was starting to attract <b>a</b>  lot of funny
<br>looks, because of Hedwig. He'd have to ask someone.
<br>
<br>He stopped <b>a</b>  passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and
<br>three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry
<br>couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was <b>in</b> , he started to
<br>get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting
<br>desperate, Harry asked for the train that left <b>at</b>  eleven o'clock, but
<br>the guard said there wasn't one. <b>In</b>  the end the guard strode away,
<br>muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic.
<br>According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes
<br>left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to <b>do</b>  it; he
<br>was stranded <b>in</b>  the middle of <b>a</b>  station with <b>a</b>  trunk he could hardly
<br>lift, <b>a</b>  pocket full of wizard money, and <b>a</b>  large owl.
<br>
<br>Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to <b>do</b> , like
<br>tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He
<br>wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket
<br>inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten.
<br>
<br><b>At</b>  that moment <b>a</b>  group of people passed just behind him and he caught <b>a</b> 
<br>few words of what they were saying.
<br>
<br>"-- packed with Muggles, of course --"
<br>
<br>Harry swung round. The speaker was <b>a</b>  plump woman who was talking to four
<br>boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing <b>a</b>  trunk like
<br>Harry's <b>in</b>  front of him -- and they had an owl.
<br>
<br>Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so
<br>did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.
<br>
<br>"Now, what's the platform number?" said the boys' mother.
<br>
<br>"Nine and three-quarters!" piped <b>a</b>  small girl, also red-headed, who was
<br>holding her hand, "Mom, can't I go... "
<br>
<br>"You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go
<br>first."
<br>
<br>What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.
<br>Harry watched, careful not to blink <b>in</b>  case he missed it -- but just as
<br>the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, <b>a</b>  large
<br>crowd of tourists came swarming <b>in</b>  front of him and by the time the last
<br>backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.
<br>
<br>"Fred, you next," the plump woman said.
<br>
<br>"I'm not Fred, I'm George," said the boy. "Honestly, woman, you call
<br>yourself our mother? CarA you tell I'm George?"
<br>
<br>"Sorry, George, dear."
<br>
<br>"Only joking, I am Fred," said the boy, and off he went. His twin called
<br>after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because <b>a</b>  second later,
<br>he had gone -- but how had he done it?
<br>
<br>Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was
<br>almost there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere.
<br>
<br>There was nothing else for it.
<br>
<br>"Excuse me," Harry said to the plump woman.
<br>
<br>"Hello, dear," she said. "First time <b>at</b>  Hogwarts? Ron's new, too."
<br>
<br>She pointed <b>at</b>  the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and
<br>gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and <b>a</b>  long nose.
<br>
<br>"Yes," said Harry. "The thing is -- the thing is, I don't know how to
<br>--"
<br>
<br>"How to get onto the platform?" she said kindly, and Harry nodded.
<br>
<br>"Not to worry," she said. "All you have to <b>do</b>  is walk straight <b>at</b>  the
<br>barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared
<br>you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best <b>do</b>  it <b>at</b>  <b>a</b>  bit of <b>a</b> 
<br>run if you're nervous. Go on, go now before Ron."
<br>
<br>"Er -- okay," said Harry.
<br>
<br>He pushed his trolley around and stared <b>at</b>  the barrier. It looked very
<br>solid.
<br>
<br>He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to
<br>platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash
<br>right into that barrier and then he'd be <b>in</b>  trouble -- leaning forward
<br>on his cart, he broke into <b>a</b>  heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer
<br>and nearer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- the cart was out of control
<br>-- he was <b>a</b>  foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash --
<br>
<br>It didn't come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes. <b>A</b>  scarlet
<br>steam engine was waiting next to <b>a</b>  platform packed with people. <b>A</b>  sign
<br>overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O'clock. Harry looked behind him
<br>and saw <b>a</b>  wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the
<br>words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.
<br>
<br>Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,
<br>while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls
<br>hooted to one another <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  disgruntled sort of way over the babble and
<br>the scraping of heavy trunks.
<br>
<br>The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging
<br>out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats.
<br>Harry pushed his cart off down the platform <b>in</b>  search of an empty seat.
<br>He passed <b>a</b>  round-faced boy who was saying, "Gran, I've lost my toad
<br>again."
<br>
<br>"Oh, Neville," he heard the old woman sigh.
<br>
<br><b>A</b>  boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by <b>a</b>  small crowd.
<br>
<br>"Give us <b>a</b>  look, Lee, go on."
<br>
<br>The boy lifted the lid of <b>a</b>  box <b>in</b>  his arms, and the people around him
<br>shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out <b>a</b>  long, hairy leg.
<br>
<br>Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment
<br>near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started
<br>to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it
<br>up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it
<br>painfully on his foot.
<br>
<br>"Want <b>a</b>  hand?" It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through
<br>the barrier.
<br>
<br>"Yes, please," Harry panted.
<br>
<br>"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!"
<br>
<br>With the twins' help, Harry's trunk was <b>at</b>  last tucked away <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  corner
<br>of the compartment.
<br>
<br>"Thanks," said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.
<br>
<br>"What's that?" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing <b>at</b>  Harry's
<br>lightning scar.
<br>
<br>"Blimey," said the other twin. "Are you
<br>
<br>"He is," said the first twin. "Aren't you?" he added to Harry.
<br>
<br>"What?" said Harry.
<br>
<br>"Harry Potter, "chorused the twins.
<br>
<br>"Oh, him," said Harry. "I mean, yes, I am."
<br>
<br>The two boys gawked <b>at</b>  him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to
<br>his relief, <b>a</b>  voice came floating <b>in</b>  through the train's open door.
<br>
<br>"Fred? George? Are you there?"
<br>
<br>"Coming, Mom."
<br>
<br>With <b>a</b>  last look <b>at</b>  Harry, the twins hopped off the train.
<br>
<br>Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the
<br>red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their
<br>mother had just taken out her handkerchief.
<br>
<br>"Ron, you've got something on your nose."
<br>
<br>The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and
<br>began rubbing the end of his nose.
<br>
<br>"Mom -- geroff" He wriggled free.
<br>
<br>"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?" said one of the
<br>twins.
<br>
<br>"Shut up," said Ron.
<br>
<br>"Where's Percy?" said their mother.
<br>
<br>"He's coming now."
<br>
<br>The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his
<br>billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed <b>a</b>  shiny silver badge
<br>on his chest with the letter P on it.
<br>
<br>"Can't stay long, Mother," he said. "I'm up front, the prefects have got
<br>two compartments to themselves --"
<br>
<br>"Oh, are you <b>a</b>  prefect, Percy?" said one of the twins, with an air of
<br>great surprise. "You should have said something, we had no idea."
<br>
<br>"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it," said the
<br>other twin. "Once --"
<br>
<br>"Or twice --"
<br>
<br>"<b>A</b>  minute --"
<br>
<br>"All summer --"
<br>
<br>"Oh, shut up," said Percy the Prefect.
<br>
<br>"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?" said one of the twins.
<br>
<br>"Because he's <b>a</b>  prefect," said their mother fondly. "All right, dear,
<br>well, have <b>a</b>  good term -- send me an owl when you get there."
<br>
<br>She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.
<br>
<br>"Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl
<br>telling me you've -- you've blown up <b>a</b>  toilet or --"
<br>
<br>"Blown up <b>a</b>  toilet? We've never blown up <b>a</b>  toilet."
<br>
<br>"Great idea though, thanks, Mom."
<br>
<br>"It's not funny. And look after Ron."
<br>
<br>"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us."
<br>
<br>"Shut up," said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already
<br>and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.
<br>
<br>"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?"
<br>
<br>Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking.
<br>
<br>"You know that black-haired boy who was near us <b>in</b>  the station? Know who
<br>he is?"
<br>
<br>"Who?"
<br>
<br>"Harry Potter!"
<br>
<br>Harry heard the little girl's voice.
<br>
<br>"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please...."
<br>
<br>"You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you
<br>goggle <b>at</b>  <b>in</b>  <b>a</b>  zoo. Is he really, Fred? How <b>do</b>  you know?"
<br>
<br>"Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really there - like lightning."
<br>
<br>"Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite
<br>when he asked how to get onto the platform."
<br>
<br>"Never mind that, <b>do</b>  you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks
<br>like?"
<br>
<br>Their mother suddenly became very stern.
<br>
<br>"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though he needs
<br>reminding of that on his first day <b>at</b>  school."
<br>
<br>"All right, keep your hair on."
<br>
<br><b>A</b>  whistle sounded.
<br>
<br>"Hurry up!" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the
<br>train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and
<br>their younger sister began to cry.
<br>
<br>"Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls."
<br>
<br>"We'll send you <b>a</b>  Hogwarts toilet seat."
<br>
<br>"George!"
<br>
<br>"Only joking, Mom."
<br>
<br>The train began to move. Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their
<br>sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train
<br>until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.
<br>
<br>Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the
<br>corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt <b>a</b>  great leap of
<br>excitement. He didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better
<br>than what he was leaving behind.
<br>
<br>The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy
<br>came <b>in</b> .
<br>
<br>"Anyone sitting there?" he asked, pointing <b>at</b>  the seat opposite Harry.
<br>"Everywhere else is full."
<br>
<br>Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced <b>at</b>  Harry and then
<br>looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked. Harry saw
<br>he still had <b>a</b>  black mark on his nose.
<br>
<br>"Hey, Ron."
<br>
<br>The twins were back.</body></html>
